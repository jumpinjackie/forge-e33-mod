Whenever a nontoken Nevron creature dies, exile it with a Foot counter.
My, what lovely feet! - Monoco has activated abilities of all Nevrons in exile with a Foot counter on them. Monoco has flying as long as an exiled Nevron creature with a Foot counter has flying. The same is true for first strike, double strike, deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, meance, reach, trample and vigilance.
{1}{G}, {T}: Monoco fights target creature.
{2}{W}: Untap Monoco.
