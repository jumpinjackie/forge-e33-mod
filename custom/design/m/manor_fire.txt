[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, this is the event that took Verso's life and started Aline's cycle of grief, made Alicia a pariah, started Clea's war against the writers and Renoir's attempts to get Aline out of the canvas, tearing the Dessendre family apart.
 - A basic foil for room strategies with a cantrip so it's not entirely useless when not facing against room strategies.
