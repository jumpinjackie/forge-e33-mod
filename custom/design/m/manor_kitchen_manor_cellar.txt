[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Kitchen connects to the entrance. The cellar is accessible after solving a puzzle in the kitchen.
 - Kitchen is an easy mechanical map to food tokens.
 - Cellar I've decided to mechanically map to Chroma/Lumina tokens as that is some of the loot that's available in the game.
