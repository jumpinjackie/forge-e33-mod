[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Mimes are special enemies encountered throughout the continent. Defeating them awards special loot.
 - You would think that mimes, that mimic things would have a blue color identity (the color of illusion and mimicry), but none of its ability set map to anything blue. So it is flavorfully a boros creature.
