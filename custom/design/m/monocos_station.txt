[FlavorText]
The Grandis have embraced us with such warmth and hope. What a balm for the soul to know that other beings survived, that we in Lumiere are not alone! It truly is a miracle.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Monoco's Station is situated in an icy and mountainous region of the continent.
 - Therefore this should clearly be a blue/red dual land.
 - Since it's occupied by Monoco (a Gestral) and various Grandis creatures. They get the no-strings-attached dual land experience.
