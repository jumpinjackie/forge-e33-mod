[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Machinepieds is an enemy found in Verso's Drafts. They have the appearance of a Gestral on wheels with boxing gloves.
 - The ability suite is very similar to that of Dominique Giant Feet, so has the same abilities but with adjusted costs.
 - 11/01/2026: Added Barbapapa debuff on ETB as Barbapapa debuff is one of its attacks.
