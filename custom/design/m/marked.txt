[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, marked is a status effect that causes the recipient to receive 50% more damage on the next hit.
 - Mechanically mapped to an aura that doubles any damage dealt to enchanted creature.
 - Basically copied the damage doubling template from Curse of Bloodletting, and swapped player for creature.
 - Added Flash for extra combat trickiness.
 - To have some utility, added Rancor's recurring effect.
