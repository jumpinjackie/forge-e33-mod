[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, The Mask Keeper is the true Axon behind Visages.
 - Main gimmick I am capturing here is the 3 masks that grant him various buffs every turn, represented in card form as counters.
    - Anger Mask: Mapped playing twice to untapping himself.
    - Joy Mask: Mapped healing himself to giving himself lifelink temporarily as self-healing is redundant in MTG (all creatures who didn't die of lethal damage self-heal at cleanup anyways).
    - Sadness Mask: Mapped exhaust to putting a stun counter on a creature.
 - The upkeep trigger wording probably sounds a bit weird. Default instinct is to use modal ability templating, but there is no textbox budget for that and there is no other precedent for templating such a triggered ability in this manner. So it is worded this way as a "creative decision".
    - This will be implemented as a modal trigger in Forge.
