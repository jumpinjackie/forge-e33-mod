[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, there are various doors scattered throughout the continent that warps you to various rooms in the Manor, unlocking some previously inaccessible rooms in the process.
 - This clearly mechanically maps to an artifact that can lock/unlock rooms ala. Keys to the House
 - Added a mana ability so it can at least function as a mana rock if there's no rooms to interact with
[Bugs]
AI seems to have issues unlocking its own doors. Check if Keys to the House has the same issues.
