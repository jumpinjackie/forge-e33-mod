[DesignNotes]
 - This symbolizes the moment after the prologue when Expedition 33 lands at Dark Shores, encounter Painted Renoir and proceed to have all but 5 members be wiped out by P.Renoir and his cohort of Nevrons.
 - Another mini-sweeper to give Nevron tribal decks some fight against "go wide" strategies.
 - 7/10/2025: Added non-Painter clause because this event was a joint Nevon/Painter production.
 - 3/11/2025: Added cycling 2 so it at least has some marginal value in draft/limited if you have this but no supporting strategy.
