# HACK: GainControl does not fizzle if the creature died at this point. It gets reanimated and control transfers to opponent!
# I am taking a page out of Chaos Lord which also has conditional control transfer and have to do this SVar check as a workaround to ensure it fizzles if it's dead at this point.

It's a gutting realization, what has to be done. The mission is too important. The team is too important. We can't just throw our lives away for nothing. I hate that it came to this, but he broke our trust.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 48 was an expedition fraught with Mutiny and Treachery.
 - The mutinous nature has been captured with this creature joining the other side when one of your Expeditioner compatriots dies.
