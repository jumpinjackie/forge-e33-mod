[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Julien is a boxing-style fighter in the Hidden Gestral Arena
 - Julien has several moves which we've mechanically translated:
     - Combo Jab: Easy. A flurry of strikes. Ergo. Double Strike
     - Uppercut: Julien's punches are so strong that an uppercut would launch his opponent into the air (in my mind). Hence, the momentary flying after being dealt 2 damage (if it survives that punch!)
     - Haymaker: Interpreted as a really heavy punch and trample is a suitable way to convey such heaviness
