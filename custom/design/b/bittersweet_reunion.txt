When this enchantment enters, target opponent discards a card and you lose 2 life.
Sacrifice this enchantment: Choose one —
• Creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.
• Creatures you control gain hexproof until end of turn. (They can’t be the targets of spells or abilities your opponents control.)
[FlavorText]
Maelle: If you’re gonna give someone flowers, you should probably do it before they wither and die.
Gustave: What? The flower? Or Sophie?
Maelle: Ooh dark. Sophie would approve.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game's prologue, Gustave reunites with Sophie on the day of her gommage. It is undoubtedly a bittersweet reunion.
 - The base template is Family Reunion, it was a case of how best to weave in the "Bittersweet" aspect.
 - Gone with an enchantment that triggers an oppoent discard and life loss (the Bittersweet part)
 - The "Family Reunion" part is an ability activated through saccing the enchantment.
