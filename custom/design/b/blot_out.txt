[DesignNotes]
 - It turns out the French name for this card is ... Gommage!
 - And in another case of serendipity, the actual ability of exiling the creature/planeswalker with the highest mana value (ergo: age) happens to be also super on-flavor. What a coincidence!
 - So a no-brainer super flavorful reprint.
