When this creature dies, target opponent creates a Lumina token.
This creature enters with a shield counter on it. (If it would be dealt damage or destroyed, remove a shield counter from it instead.)

[DesignNotes]
 - Just a vanilla hill giant. Has shield counters because its game counterpart always has one and Shield counters are near 1:1 mechanically.
