[DesignNotes]
 - No in-game basis, but Grief is such a central theme of Expedition 33 that having a cycle dedicated to the 5 stages is a total flavor nuke.
 - Bargaining is the third stage. On name-basis alone you would think this is easily a black creature with "life for cards" motif, but it is actually green because this is the color that has the hardest time thematically associating to any of the 5 stages. Bargaining has some thematic leeway with green if you try to view it through a "Greater Good" kind of lens and thus I went with a creature variation of Greater Good.
 - 17/11/2025: Changed PT from 4/4 to 4/5
 - 21/11/2025: Added nonland clause to avoid being able to sac The Reacher for +5 net CA without any mana investment first.
