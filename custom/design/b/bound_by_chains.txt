[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, various Nevrons have an attack, which if not parried or dodged will apply a bound status on the attack recipient. A bound party member visually looks like someone tethered to the ground with chains.
 - I've gone with a 1:1 copy of Rising Waters to solidify the Crippling Tsunami Prison archetype and to boost the Blue Skies archetype as something that can captialize on tempo gains.
    - I would've gone with a nickname reprint, but to my knowledge Forge only lets you nickname cards in the source card script (the card from Nemesis) which is too invasive.
