Devoid (This card has no color.)
When this creature dies, target opponent creates a Lumina token.
This creature gets +2/+2 and Ward 2 if you control a creature named Cruler.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Bruler is generally in a party with Cruler. Thus I've gone with giving Bruler a buff if you also control Cruler
