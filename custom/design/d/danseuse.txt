Devoid $DEVOID_REMINDER_TEXT
When this creature dies, target opponent creates a Lumina token.
{R},{T}: This creature deals 2 damage to target creature.
{U},{T}: Tap target creature. Put a stun counter on it.\nWhen this creature dies, if you control no creatures, put two 2/2 Red and Blue Danseuse Clone creature tokens into play.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, a Danseuse attacks with fire and ice magic. If it is the only enemy left in battle, it can summon up to 2 clones.
 - Mechanically I went with:
     - A creature shock ability for the fire/red ability
     - Tap and stun for the ice/blue ability
     - For the clone ability, I preserved the original triggering condition but went against making token copies as that seemed really degenerate as the cloning trigger would also pass on to the tokens.
