[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, a Danseuse attacks with fire and ice magic. If it is the only enemy left in battle, it can summon up to 2 clones.
 - Mechanically I went with:
    - A creature shock ability for the fire/red ability
    - Tap and stun for the ice/blue ability
    - For the clone ability, I preserved the original triggering condition but went against making token copies as that seemed really degenerate as the cloning trigger would also pass on to the tokens.
 - 13/10/2025: Removed Devoid.
 - 13/12/2025: Increased activated ability costs by {2}
