Trample
{2}: Put a flying counter on Dominique.
Two-handed slam - {2},{T},Remove a flying counter from Dominique: Dominique deals 4 damage to target creature.
At the beginning of each end step, remove all flying counters on Dominique.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Dominique is a fighter in the Hidden Gestral Arena
 - With the two-handed slam ability Dominique leaps into the air and slams the opponent. I've mechanically translated this to giving Dominique an ability to add a flying counter (the jump) and another ability to deal the damage at the cost of some mana and removing a flying counter (the slam).
 - The end step removing all flying counters trigger is insurance against "banking" excess flying counters.
 - We use flying counters as opposed to temporarily granting the flying keyword as flying counters are logistically simpler to manage.
