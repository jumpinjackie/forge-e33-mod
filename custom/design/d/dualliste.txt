[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Dualliste is a mid-game boss of Act 2.
 - Since the boss battle is in a death pit with a knee-deep pool of blood, all his abilities revolve around blood tokens.
 - Double strike because he does a lot of combo attacks.
 - Inverted status translated to setting a creature's base toughness to 1 until EOT.
