[DesignNotes]
 - No in-game basis, but Grief is such a central theme of Expedition 33 that having a cycle dedicated to the 5 stages is a total flavor nuke.
 - Depression is the fourth stage. I've gone with a souped up version of Melancholy.
 - 1/1/2026: Fix stun trigger happening in any zone, when it should only be on the battlefield.
