Creatures cannot attack you unless their controller sacrifices a Chroma token for each creature they control that's attacking you.
{3}: Create a Chroma token. Any player may activate this ability.
[FlavorText]
This looks similar to Lumière's shield dome. Maybe we can just cross it.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Chroma Barrier protects The Monolith from external intrusion. Only Expedition 70, 60 and 33 have successfully breached this barrier.
 - I've mechanically mapped this to a Ghostly Prison style effect, but the attacking tax is Chroma counters.
 - To make it fair for players without a Chroma token generation strategy, I've added a symmetrical Chroma token generation ability. Thus the real attacking tax is {3} or saccing a Chroma token.
