[DesignNotes]
 - Represents the effect inflicted on a good bunch of previous Expeditioners that turned them into statues with their Chroma trapped within.
 - I orignally wanted this to turn into a "do nothing" artifact, but I think the "Enchant creature" restriction means this is a nonbo and the aura immediately "falls off". Will revisit later with "Enchant permanent" to see if this gives my desired result.
    - Until then, I've gone with a 0/1 artifact creature.
    - 23/09/2025: Now enchanting permanents so we can achieve the "inert artifact" effect. A slight flavor loss since this can now target more than just creatures, but I am more after the petrification effect than it needing to only target creatures
