[DesignNotes]
 - In the game's prologue, Colette can be found at the Expedition Festival. You can trade her a festival token for an old key, which unlocks a gate in Old Lumiere where a Fracture Survivor journal can be found.
 - Since she deals with all things artifacts and trinkets, gone with a mashup of Etherium Sculptor and a Riddlesmith looting trigger.
