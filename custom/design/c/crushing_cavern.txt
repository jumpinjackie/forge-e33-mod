[FlavorText]
... But both my legs are crushed as well and I don't know how much longer I have. I wish I could have avenged you all. If anyone finds this journal, do not enter this cave, the Nevron inside will crush you.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game the Crushing Cavern is a location where the player engages in a time-limited battle with the Giant Sapling. Failing to defeat the Giant Sapling results in a crushing defeat. The journal in this area recalls a previous failed attempt at defeating the Giant Sapling.
 - Mechanically represented as Pit Trap on a land. Comes into to play tapped to give any creature already on the battlefield at least one turn to get their shot in before they become the potential kill target.
