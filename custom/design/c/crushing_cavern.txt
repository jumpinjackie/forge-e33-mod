[DesignNotes]
 - In the game the Crushing Cavern is a location where the player engages in a time-limited battle with the Giant Sapling. Failing to defeat the Giant Sapling results in a crushing defeat. The journal in this area recalls a previous failed attempt at defeating the Giant Sapling.
 - Mechanically represented as Pit Trap on a land. Comes into to play tapped to give any creature already on the battlefield at least one turn to get their shot in before they become the potential kill target.
