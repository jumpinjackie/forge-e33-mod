[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Chapelier summons jars to attack the party if not shot down and causes party exhaustion on defeat.
 - Gave it a token generation ability and mechanically represent exhaustion with tap + stun counter.
 - 13/10/2025: Removed Devoid.
 - 14/12/2025: Remove jar nevron token ability with a mask silencing ability, having played the game again with the new DLC release. The game guide I referred to and based the original abilities on clearly lied to me.
