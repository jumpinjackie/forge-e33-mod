[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Crippling Tsunami is one of Lune's skills. It's basically an AOE variant of Ice Lance.
 - Made this a hybrid of Glare of Subdual and Opposition. Base effect is Glare, but Expeditioners can have the full Opposition experience.
 - Intentionally worded so that any Expeditioner permanent can be used to tap down. May change this to Expeditioner creatures only if proven to be too powerful.
