[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Chaliers can be found in the Forgotten Battlefield.
 - Vanilla Nevron. Could not determine approporiate color/elemental affinity so it's colorless.
 - 12/11/2025: Made it green and gave it a shield counter to emphasize its tough armored exterior.
 - 13/12/2025: Upon reviewing this enemy in game in a new DLC playthrough, made it black, changed cost to 2B and P/T to 3/2 and removed shield counter.
