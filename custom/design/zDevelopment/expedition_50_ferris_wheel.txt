[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 50 built a giant ferris wheel to traverse the waters of the continent, but Serpenphare stopped their progression.
 - This card depicts this contraption. Clearly a vehicle with fatty stats. The weakness to blue creatures in combat is a nod to Serpenphare being the wheel's achillies' heel.
