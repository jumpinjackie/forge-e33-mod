[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, The Paintress is the main antagonist, until the conclusion of Act 2, when you discover she is not.
 - Abilities drawn from the various moves she has in her boss battle. Because 2 of these 3 abilities already exist as separate cards, we've gone with slight tweaks/variations for the abilities here.
    - Void Meteors: Only deals 3 damage and can only target creatures.
    - Rips apart reality: Phases out permanents instead of putting it on top/bottom of owner's library.
 - As much as I personally despise double-faced cards (because of logistics around limited and sleeves, requiring paper hacks like checklist cards), flavorfully this has to be a creature that transforms to her Planeswalker half.
