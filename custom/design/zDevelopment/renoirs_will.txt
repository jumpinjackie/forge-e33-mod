Until end of turn, you may play lands and cast Nevron or Gradient spells from your graveyard.
If a card would be put into your graveyard from anywhere this turn, exile that card instead.
[FlavorText]
I know it seems absurd to offer oblivion as recompense, but perhaps that's the outcome we both desire.

[DesignNotes]
 - The card symbolizes the moment that Renoir was finally free from the bottom of the Monolith upon the defeat of The Paintress and Aline was expelled from the canvas and now had free reign to carry out his will: To destroy the canvas.
 - So mechanically, we've gone with a variation of Yawgmoth's Will, but with extra restrictions on the type of cards that can be replayed, allowing us to keep the same mana cost.
