[DesignNotes]
 - In Act 3 of the game, Renoir (now free) summons an assortment of Nevrons, including twisted copies of the citizens of Lumiere to carry out his mission of destroying the canvas.
 - Easy mechanical map to a clone/copy effect, but for flavor purposes, will only clone a nonlegendary Expeditioner.
