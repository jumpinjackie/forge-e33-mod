[ArtNotes]
An Expedition 33 member swiftly dodges an enemy strike.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, enemy attacks can be dodged or parried. A dodge performed at the right time is a perfect dodge.
 - Mechanically translated to a basic blink effect. Can be used as a defensive combat trick or to milk extra ETB triggers on your creatures.
