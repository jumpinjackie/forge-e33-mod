[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Painted Clea was painted by Aline, but was then repainted over by the real Clea and re-purposed to be what amounts to an endless "Nevron factory"
 - Mechanically, Painted Clea is our Nevorn lord, so I've gone with an assortment of "build around" abilities.
     - Nevron cost reduction
     - Nevron P/T buffs
     - Ability to put out Nevron tokens automatically every upkeep
     - A Nevron tutoring ability
 - NOTE: This is not the Clea Planeswalker so Francois does not have affinity towards it. Nothing in the actual game suggests Francois has any affection towards Clea's painted counterpart.
