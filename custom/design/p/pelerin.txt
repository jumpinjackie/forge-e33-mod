[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Pelerins can be encountered in Frozen Hearts
 - Has the same "flip-flop" elemental immunity as Stalact and Gargant, so has the same flip-flop protection.
 - Copied counterattack ability from Boucheclier as this is its primary gimmick in the game (always retaliating against whoever dealt damage to it)
