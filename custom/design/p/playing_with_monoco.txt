[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, inside Verso's Treehouse in Verso's Drafts, there are various artpieces depicting Verso interacting with various family members. One of them is him playing with his dog, Monoco.
 - Mapped to a fight-based combat trick. A target creature will get a stick, which you can "sic a dog" on at a later point in time (via fighting)
