[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Painting Workshop is an area where one must collect 3 items to unlock a barrier, where a Lampmaster boss battle happens.
 - Gone with a card that is a value engine for Painter/Gradient strategies.
 - This is an enchantment instead of a land as we've got enough non-basic lands in this set.
