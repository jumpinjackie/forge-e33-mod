[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Painted Alicia is the painted counterpart of Alicia
 - Thematically gone with another variant of silence effects to mirror her human counterpart.
    - In this case, an Ethersworn Canonist with Nevron/Painter bias.
    - And a Silence effect for the cost of 3 chroma tokens.
 - 4/11/2025: Exchanged abiltiies with human Alicia. Replaced Nevrons with Expeditioners for the null rod effect.
