[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Osquio is the final boss of Verso's Drafts. He is Esquie's evil cousin and has all the moves an mannerisms of a Professional Wrestler.
 - Obviously a DFC where his Phase 1 form transforms to his Phase 2 form. Abilities I've translated are:
    - Spawning Osquio's Mask tokens
    - Goblin Sharpshooter's pinging ability
    - Applying Barbapapa debuffs when damaging any creature in his Phase 2 form
 - The "Decides to destroy the world. Bye bye" ability has an "unless a player pays {6}" clause as a nod to the fact that this attack must be parried (stopped), but you only have one small window to pull it off.
