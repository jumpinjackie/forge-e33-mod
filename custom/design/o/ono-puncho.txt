Whenever ~ is dealt damage, return it to its owner's hand.

But remember, once you hit me, the battle's over, so make it count!

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Ono-Puncho resides in the Gestral Village, you can challenge him a battle to win a prize. The gimmick is that you only have one shot to deal 9999 damage.
 - We've translated that gimmick to a bounce trigger when it's dealt damage (signifying end of battle). To kill it means to "make it count" and deal it lethal damage so that state-based effects will send it to the graveyard before the bounce trigger can save it.
