[DesignNotes]
 - "I know what he'll say, but this is the first time I've felt any surcease" - Aline's journal.
 - Another excuse to put a perfectly cromulent word into card form.
 - Dictionary defn: To put to an end.
 - Easy map to creature kill. Go with Fatal Push, but the higher targeting bonus comes from controlling a painter.
