[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Shot pictos come in many prefixed variants, that all do something when the equipped character dies.
 - This is the last of 3 "epic" tier pictos that are modeled on one of these pictos that have many prefixed variants.
 - See Attack Picto for original design motivation for these "epic" tier pictos.
 - The picto grant the equipped creature a shooting ability and will do the following on damage dealt based on the type of counters chosen, in this case:
    - Breaking: Tap and stun targeted creature (if it didn't die from the shot)
    - Energizing: Reward a Chroma + Lumina token
    - Piercing: Shoot targeted creature's controller for the same amount of damage
