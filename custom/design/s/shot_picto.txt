When ~ enters, choose two —
• Put a breaking counter on ~
• Put an energizing counter on ~
• Put a piercing counter on ~

Whenever equipped creature deals damage to a creature, create a Chroma token if ~ has an energizing counter, tap that creature and put a stun counter on it if ~ has a breaking counter, and it deals that amount of damage to its controller if ~ has a piercing counter.
