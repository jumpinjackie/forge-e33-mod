Until end of turn, target creature gains “When this creature dies, return it to the battlefield tapped under its owner’s control with a +1/+1 counter on it.”
[FlavorText]
My love. These foes are beneath you. You, who have fought heaven and earth... And subdued giants... To find me. To free me from her grasp. Would you fall now to the likes of them? While your oath remains unfulfilled? Rise. Your enemies await.
