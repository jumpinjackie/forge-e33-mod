[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Serpenphare is an optional end-game boss. Its most prominent attack is an AP draining ability, if it consumes too much AP with this move, it will explode.
 - Mechanically, we modeled the AP draining ability as a tap and stun with a charge counter being given. The "explode" ability is modeled as removing X charge counters to X damage to every creature (including itself)
 - 19/11/2025: Increased tap-and-stun cost from 1U to 2U. Also added ability words.
