[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Stendhal is one of Maelle's skills. It is unlocked in Act 3 and it notable for being hideously overpowered with the right combination of pictos/luminas and buffs and forms the basis of many "one shot" character builds.
 - Taken another chance to weave in a use of the number 33 by dealing that much to a creature or planeswalker. When you absolutely need to kill something, accept no substitute.
 - Has devoid because it deals extreme void damage in-game.
 - Has Affinity for Lumina (tokens) to not only make casting this easier, but also as a nod to the pictos/lumina investment required in-game to make Stendhal deal damage in the millions.
 - I orignally had thoughts about making it targeting players as well, but with some side-mission you must take to unlock the ability to target players (whether by suspend or mana payment requirements), but decided against that as this set already has 2 "you win the game if certain conditions are met" cards. That's enough, we don't need another one.
