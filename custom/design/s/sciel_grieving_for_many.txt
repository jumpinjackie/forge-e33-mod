[DesignNotes]
 - Sciel is a kind, emphatheic, nurturing character that specializes in weapons and attacks that deal dark damage. Clearly an Orzhov color identity.
 - In the game, Sciel's attacks build up foretell, which can then be consumed later on for even more powerful attacks. We are using Foretell in the literal sense by re-using the existing Foretell mechanic by having Sciel granting all nonland cards in your hand to be foretelled.
 - Marking Card is just a creature ping that puts a marked counter on it. A creature with a marked counter will be a magnet for more damage.
 - Grim Harvest deals dark damage heals allies. Translated to a creature bolt that also gives you life.
 - Intervention in the game lets an ally play immediately and gain 4 AP. Translated to untapping a creature and giving you a Chroma token.
 - Our Sacrifice in the game deals extreme dark damage to all enemies, absorbing allies' health to deal more damage. Translated to paying X life to -X/-X an opponent's board.
 - 13/10/2025: Dropped the marking card ability due to text box budget constraints having seen this card for the first time in CardConjurer.
