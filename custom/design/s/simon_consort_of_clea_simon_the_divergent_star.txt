[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Simon is a secret endgame boss and is the hardest boss in the game.
 - He is mechanically represented as follows:
    - A double-faced card to represent Phase 1 (front face) and Phase 2/3 (back face)
    - Transforms on death in line with him advancing to Phase 2 upon defeating him in Phase 1.
    - "Gathers Chroma" translated to setting a creature's toughness to 1. Available on both sides in line with this ability being available in all phases.
    - Back side has double strike as a nod to 80% of his moves in the game being rapid-fire swings of his sword.
    - Back side enters with a foreboding counter as a signal that something bad is going to happen soon if Simon is not dealt with quickly.
    - Mapped "The dead are removed from the canvas" to a "Rest in Peace" continuous exile effect. Is in line with what happens when any of your party members die in combat (they are immediately erased).
    - Mapped "The Expedition is removed from the canvas" as a mass exile effect that spares only Simon and one of opponent's creatures. This is the ability spent with the foreboding counter.
 - 13/12/2025: "Simon, The Divergent Star" is now the name of the v2.0 Simon boss in the Endless Tower with the new DLC. Not changing the name of the back half as this name had existed long before the release of this DLC.
