[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Sunniso is guarding the entrance to Esquie's Nest.
 - Given existing precedent (Waterfront Bouncer), this clearly should have a creature bounce ability. However since bouncing is natively a blue ability, and we've determined Gestrals to be artifact creatures, the bounce ability here is costed at a premium to compensate for its out-of-flavor-ness.
