[DesignNotes]
 - This is one of the Paintress' moves in the boss fight with her.
 - May or may not have any mechanical relation. I needed a soft-removal spell for blue in this slot and the name was a good enough match for such an effect.
 - 13/10/2025: Removed Devoid.
 - 2/12/2025: Converted to a Repulse with a painter's bonus of an additional target. The "up to one target creature" wording on the base ability is to facilitate simpler card implementation in forge.
