Kicker — {2}, Exert a tapped creature you control.
~ deals 2 damage to target creature. If this spell was kicked, ~ deals 4 damage instead.
[FlavorText]
Have you tried throwing with your other arm instead? If you could hit the Paintress directly that would be useful.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Gustave has a penchant for throwing rocks.
 - To give green some bones in spot removal for draft/limited, this is a shock for creatures that can be upgraded in damage.
 - 1/1/2026: Fixed the kicker to exert a tapped creature as exert does not tap the creature as part of the exerting. I don't believe Forge supports a "tap and exert" action, so this is the closest thing.
