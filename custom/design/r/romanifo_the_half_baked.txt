[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Romanifo can be found in Verso's Drafts. Popping his balloons provokes him into a fight where he is invincible. He can only be damaged by popping all of his balloons.
 - Mapped his gimmick to spawning a token equipment that grants flying. While this token equipment is under your control, Romanifo is indestructible to match his video game immunity to any damage.
