{1}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact and any number of token permanents you control: Choose one -
 - Create X Chroma tokens, where X is the number of sacrificed permanents.
 - Create X Lumina tokens, where X is the number of sacrificed permanents.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, recoats are tints that let you respec your character attributes.
 - I've interpreted this as an artifact that let's you convert/respec tokens into Chroma or Lumina tokens.
