Sacrifice a Chroma token: This creature loses defender. (This effect lasts indefinitely.)
[FlavorText]
All this chroma has been rather... energizing. Thanks to you, I awaken from my slumber. Did my tales interest you this much?

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, an Unfinished Bénisseur can be found in the Red Woods. It assumes the appearance of a "Wishing Well" requiring several Chroma donations of increasing quantities, which at that point it finally reveals itself and rewards you with a picto.
 - Mapped this to a cost-efficient creature with defender requiring a simple Chroma token "payment" to remove defender.
