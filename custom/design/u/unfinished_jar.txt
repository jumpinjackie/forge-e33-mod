[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, an Unfinished Jar can be found in Spring Meadows. It wants you to find something (resin) to light its lamp. Doing so will reward you wtih a healing tint shard.
 - Modeled this as a "vanilla" Nevron that "lights up" with extra abilities and beneficial ETB triggers if you spend extra colors of mana (the light) on it. If you can spend all 5 colors of mana on it, you get the full suite of benefits.
