[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Unfinished Bourgeon can be found in a small cave. It is a small bourgeon that wants to consume the skin of a slain Bourgeon to be able to grow into a full size Bourgeon.
 - Modeled this as a tiny Nevron that gets skin counters on Nevron death that grows into a big boy Bourgeon for 3 skin counters.
    - Granting skin counters on any Nevron death is a small thematic compromise as there's only one Bourgeon in this set and that's too marginal of a triggering condition, even if it's lore accurate.
