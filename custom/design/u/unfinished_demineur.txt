[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, an Unfinished Démineur can be found in Flying Waters. It is missing its mine. Returning back its missing mine will reward you with a picto.
 - Modeled this as a tiny Nevron with a one-time sac of a nontoken artifact (the missing "mine") to turn it to its fully realized self.
