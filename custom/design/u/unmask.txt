[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, at camp after slaying the two Axons and acquiring the Barrier Breaker, the party sleeps except for Verso, who is approached by Painted Alicia, who hands him a letter intended for Maelle, in that moment Verso removes her mask, stating she does not need to wear it.
 - Perfect flavorful reprint of Unmask.
