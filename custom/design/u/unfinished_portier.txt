[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Unfinished Portier can be found in the Esoteric Ruins. It appears as its "weak point" missing a body, returning a set of wooden boards to it will "complete" it to a regular Portier.
 - Modeled as a tiny Nevron that can be "converted" to a regular Portier by saccing a Forest. Because a Forest is ... a source of wood!
