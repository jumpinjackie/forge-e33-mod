[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Unfinished Troubador can be found in the Stone Quarry. It wants you to "teach" it how to play music, which consists of a parry challenge by parrying the "bad" notes and taking in the "good" notes. Passing the challenge will reward you with a picto.
 - Modeled as a bear that can fulfill one of its Troubador "roles" if you spend the right colors of mana on it.
