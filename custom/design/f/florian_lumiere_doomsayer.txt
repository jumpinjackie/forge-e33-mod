[DesignNotes]
 - In the game's prologue, Florian can be seen near the harbor, preaching the end of days.
 - Mapped doomsaying > prediction. Thus has an upkeep trigger that lets you "predict" the top card of your library, if you guess right you get the card, otherwise it's milled.
 - Scry and Surveil abilities are to let you "shape your destiny".
