[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, this is one of Sciel's quotes during battle.
 - Design-wise fully leaned in on the pun and based it around using "your deck" to take out any creature, if you can afford to mill the number of cards required.
 - Mild thematic mismatch as blue is not really part of Sciel's color identity or skillset IMO, but the milling and returning cards to hand from graveyard is in blue's wheelhouse.
