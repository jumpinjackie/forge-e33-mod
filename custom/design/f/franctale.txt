[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Franctales can be found in Verso's Drafts. It has the appearance of a tall Gestral with a Francois-like turtle as its head.
 - Has Reach because it's tall!
 - Main gimmick we're translating is its shell attack where it detaches its head and kicks it like a soccer ball towards you.
