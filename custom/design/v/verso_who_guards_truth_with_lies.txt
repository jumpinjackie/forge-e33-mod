[DesignNotes]
 - The main gimmick we want to mechanically capture is his rank. Rank is gained from dealing damage and is lost on taking damage.
 - Easy map to gain/loss of rank counters on dealing damage/taking damage. For game balance, Verso will lose all rank counters on a single hit.
 - Resurrection ability because he's immortal.
 - Added an assortment of buffs and abilities that are conditional on the number of rank counters.
 - "Phantom Stars" ultimate is paid in rank counters for game balance purposes. In game, none of Verso's abilities cost him is rank.
