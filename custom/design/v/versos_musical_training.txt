[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, inside Verso's Treehouse in Verso's Drafts, there are various artpieces depicting Verso interacting with various family members. One of them is him playing the piano in front of his mother, Aline.
 - Near-functional reprint of Legacy's Allure with different counter type and different mana cost to offset its better splashability.
