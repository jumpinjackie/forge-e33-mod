[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, this is one of the Paintress' moves in the boss fight with her.
 - Mechanically, I based this on Pyrotechnics, but moved to Rakdos colors and with a Painter's discount.
 - 13/10/2025: Removed Devoid.
 - 15/11/2025: Devoid is back on the menu. I figured out how to add colorless frame layer to CardConjurer.
