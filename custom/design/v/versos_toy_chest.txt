[DesignNotes]
 - In the game a Toy Chest can be found in Verso's Treehouse in Verso's Drafts.
 - This card depicts this artifact.
 - Translated to a creature token maker. Only has 3 charges because a Toy Chest can only contain so much toys inside.
 - A well behaved child will return these toys when done playing with them, thus it has a toy sac ability to put extra counters on it (returning the toys).
 - Intentionally worded to allow saccing any Toy permanent (there are a few others in this set)
