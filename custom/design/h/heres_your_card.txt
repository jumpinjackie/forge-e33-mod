B
[Types]
Kindred Instant - Expeditioner
[Oracle]
Target creature gets -2/-2 until end of turn.
Foretell {0} (During your turn, you may pay {2} and exile this card from your hand face down. Cast it on a later turn for its foretell cost.)
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, this is one of Sciel's quotes when performing a regular attack.
 - Simple targeted creature kill with Foretell to name-tie (not mechanically-tie) it to Sciel's skillset. The keyword ability is already there, so let's just use it!
