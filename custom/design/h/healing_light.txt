[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Healing Light is one of Lune's abilities that heals an ally.
 - Easy mechanical translation to life gain, but with a twist. It's symmetrical for a reason: As an enabler for The 67th Gommage.
     - Thus a card like this will not only help buy extra turns to get you to 6 mana to cast The 67th gommage, but also to get your opponent to 33 life or above.
