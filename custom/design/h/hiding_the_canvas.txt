Exile target nonland permanent and put three time counters on it. If it doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend. (At the beginning of its owner’s upkeep, they remove a time counter. When the last is removed, they may play it without paying its mana cost. If it’s a creature, it has haste.)
[FlavorText]
Alicia: If we bring Maman out of the Canvas, she'll try to return. We must hide the Canvas...
Clea: Well-reasoned. And such a... clever hiding spot you've chosen.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Alicia concots a plan to hide Verso's canvas first before entering and attempting to help expel Aline out of the canvas. Clea approves of her clever idea.
 - Gone with a card similar to Suspend (from MH2) but bumped up the cost to 1U and allow targeting any nonland permanent and suspending them for 3 time counters.
