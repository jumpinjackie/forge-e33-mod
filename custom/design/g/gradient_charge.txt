[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Gradient attacks are "Epic" tier attacks. To use such attacks you need to fill up a Gradient gauge. The Gradient gauge holds up to 3 charges. Gradient attacks cost anywhere between 1 to 3 charges.
 - Mechanically, this is just a Gradient spell tutor to assist in Painter-based strategies.
