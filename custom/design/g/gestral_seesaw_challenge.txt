[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Gestral Seesaw Challenge is 1 of 2 challenge minigames in Verso's Drafts. In this minigame you must time jumps on a seesaw.
 - This enchantment grows quest counters from you flying creatures entering or attacking. The see-saw effect is acheived by this enchantment losing quest counters from opponents doing the same thing with their flyers.
 - The final payoff is lord P/T buff.
