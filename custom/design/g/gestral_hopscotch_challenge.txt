Whenever a creature you control with flying enters or a creature you control with flying attacks, you may put a quest counter on this enchantment.
Remove nine quest counters from this enchantment and exile it: Each player shuffles their hand and graveyard into their library, then draws seven cards. Activate only as a sorcery.

[Bugs]
 - If you back out of the Timetwister ability activation after removing 9 quest counters, you will not get back those counters.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Gestral Hopscotch Challenge is 1 of 2 challenge minigames in Verso's Drafts. In this minigame you must walk/jump from tiles 1 to 9 in sequence. Completing the challenge rewards you with a new haircut.
 - Same quest counter trigger condition as the ascension challenge. Originally I wanted something that triggers on the gain/loss of flying on any creature (to thematically map to hopping), but there is no existing precendent for triggers from the gain or loss of a particular ability, so this isn't possible to implement.
 - The final payoff is a Timetwister effect. Exile cost to prevent recursion in multiples as-is standard with most Timetwister-style spells. 9 quest counters is the activation threshold as the Hopscotch ends at the 9th tile.
