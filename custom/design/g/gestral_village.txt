[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, this is the home of the Gestrals.
 - A sol land for Gestral tribal decks. Due to their artifact nature, Gestrals are significantly easier to cast (unlike Eldrazi which require explicit coloress-pip producing lands), so where applicable, costs have increased, but this card is a bone thrown to to this deck to allow for some acceleration.
