Gustave, wait! It seems peaceful, as long as we don't touch the flowers.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Goblu is the boss of Flying Waters.
 - Main gimmick we want to mechanically translate is Goblu's flower growing and consuming ability.
    - Represented Red and Blue flowers as separate artifact tokens.
    - Flower consumption is represented as abilities that trigger on Red/Blue Flower sacrifice (independent of the sac ability)
 - 25/10/2025: 
    - Added reach. 
    - Removed Red/Blue Flower tokens and gone with just a Flower token to which is a temur mana rock. There's not enough text box budget to mention two different tokens and the triggering off of both of them. 
    - Changed Flower leave triggers to a (mandatory) modal choice off of any flower token leaving. This was because Forge does not seem to acknowledge token leave triggers of a specific token name.
       - The shield and +1/+1 counter abiliies from the blue/red flower tokens have been moved here.
