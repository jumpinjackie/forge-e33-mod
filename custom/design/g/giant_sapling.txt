[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Giant Sapling is the boss in the Crushing Cavern.
 - Main gimmick being captured is its countdown to crushing doom.
 - Unfortunately, countdown via counters is hard because there is no precedent for a triggered ability on the removal of the last counter that is not a terminal ability (ie. The permanent sticks around afterwards). So it looks like my original intent of crushing on the last counter removal is not possible.
 - So I have pivoted to the crush ability being an Exhaust one, paid for with 3 counters, which you gain one every turn. So an opponent has 3 turns to deal with this creature before most of the board is wiped, flavorfully retaining the urgency of needing to dispatch this creature in the actual video game.
