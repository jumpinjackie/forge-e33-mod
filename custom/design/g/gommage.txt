[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Gommage is a yearly event where people above a certain age (indicated on the Monolith) are erased from existence. It is also a gradient attack power that Maelle gains in the late game that can deal extreme singular damage.
 - Mechanically, this is easily a mass exile effect. It spares legendaries and Nevrons as this event only affects the humans of the continent.
 - Has painter's discount as this is clearly a power wielded by the painters.
