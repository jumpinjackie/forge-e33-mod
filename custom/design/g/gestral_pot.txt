[DesignNotes]
 - Gestral version of Guardian Idol.
 - A mana rock to support the Gestral tribal strategy, while providing some extra offensive punch if required.
 - 13/10/2025: Formerly known as Gestral Statue. Renamed because Gestral Pots have an actual in-game basis. They are in front of the Dark Gestral Arena and a living Gestral is inside it.
