Tap an untapped Gestral you control: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to target creature this turn.
[FlavorText]
Even if there is no competition here because everyone is dumb, I pushed myself through self-discipline. And I saved more than ten thousand of my fellow Gestrals. All the while, suffering inside like no one else in this world. So don't tell me what I am.
