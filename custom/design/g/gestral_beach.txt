[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, various Gestral beaches in the continent are home to various challenge mini-games.
 - Origially I wanted a cheaper cycling 1 ability if you control a Gestral, but I don't think Forge supports multiple cycling abilities as it is keyworded, so I can't attach conditions to a keyworded ability.
