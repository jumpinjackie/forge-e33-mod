[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, there is a mini game where you have to win a game of gestral volleyball against a Sakapatate who flings little gestrals at you. You win the mini game by parrying the flung gestrals back at the Sakapatate a certain number of times. Failure to parry will damage the raft you are standing on an after a certain number of hits, the raft explodes and you will lose the mini game.
 - Gestral version of Goblin Grenade / Reckless Abandon
 - Made it a bit more expensive to offset the ease of casting gestral creatures in general and the fact that a Gestral sol land is in this set.
