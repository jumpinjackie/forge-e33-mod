When this creature enters and whenever it attacks, it explores. (Reveal the top card of your library. Put that card into your hand if it’s a land. Otherwise, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature, then put the card back or put it into your graveyard.)
[FlavorText]
This pathway leads to the treacherous region of the mountains. If your destination is Old Lumière, you should leave via the other exit.
