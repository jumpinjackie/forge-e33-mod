[FlavorText]
Sunniso: Geez, you don't need to be so rude.
Gustave: Nononono, uh ... it's just, um ... it's the password ...
Sunniso: Well, I don't know! Golgra never told me the password. But whatever, just go in.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, this is the "password" Golgra passed down to the Expeditioners to get past the Gestral guards at Esquie's Nest
 - Mechanically, it make sense (and is hilarious) to make Gestrals unable to block.
