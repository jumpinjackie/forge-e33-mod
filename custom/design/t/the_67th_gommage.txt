[DesignNotes]
 - This is meant to flavorfully and mechanically represent the moment Renoir triggers the 67th gommage, erasing every human 33 years and older.
 - Except in our case, instead of humans, it's players and instead of age its life total. Basically this card is just another excuse to weave in a thematic and flavorful use of the number 33.
 - Further playtesting may reveal the truth, but I don't believe the win condition is *that easy* to achieve. It goes against the general plan of victory for most decks, which is to get your opponent to 0 or less life. So having to get your opponent to above a certain life total to enable the victory condition is at least a unique angle.
