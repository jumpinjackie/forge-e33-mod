You may have this land enter tapped as a copy of any land on the battlefield, except it has "At the beginning of your upkeep, you may have this land become a copy of target land, and it has this ability."
[FlavorText]
It bears the twisted memories of lands previously visited.
[ForgeScript]
# Carbon-copy of Vesuvan Doppelganger except it targets lands and removes color preservation and ETB tapped
# Make Svars for granting abilities and triggers on clones distinct to avoid SVars getting overwritten when cloning a clone

[Bugs]
 - The copy trigger doubles up if you happen to target itself with the copy ability. I copied this implementation from Vesuvan Doppelganger. Does it have the same problem?
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the interior of The Monolith contains twisted variations of locations visited by Expedition 33
 - Basically a Vesuvan Doppelganger for lands. Meant to mechanically capture the memories of places visited by Expedition 33
 - I am hoping I can copy Vesuvan Doppelganger for the most part and change the targeting parameters from creatures to lands.
 - 5/10/2025: It works!
 - May change targeting to only non-basic lands to curb power level if required.
