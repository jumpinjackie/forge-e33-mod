 - On death, the commander AI never wants to take the transform to planeswalker option, always opting to send it back to the command zone.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, The Paintress is the main antagonist, until the conclusion of Act 2, when you discover she is not. She is in fact, trying to *protect* the people of Lumière from the true instigator of the yearly Gommages (Renoir) and her yearly countdown on The Monolith is a signal of her waning powers in fighting against this tide.
 - Abilities drawn from the various moves she has in her boss battle. Because 2 of these 3 abilities already exist as separate cards, we've gone with slight tweaks/variations for the abilities here.
   - Void Meteors: Only deals 3 damage and can only target creatures.
   - Rips apart reality: Phases out permanents instead of putting it on top/bottom of owner's library.
 - As much as I personally despise double-faced cards (because of logistics around limited and sleeves, requiring paper hacks like checklist cards), flavorfully this has to be a creature that transforms to her Planeswalker half.
   - If we ever print this, it will be printed over 2 cards and not as a double-faced one, because I want a printed version of this set to be playable as-is without sleeves (as Richard Garfield intended).
 - In terms of planeswalker design, the primary theme is around Chroma and her mastery of it.
 - 29/11/2025: Void meteor ability cost adjust so that she can be a 5c commander.
