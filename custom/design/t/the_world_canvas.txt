[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the continent is discovered to be inside a living canvas. The final part of the game is about deciding the fate of this canvas.
 - Mechanically:
    - The "black lotus" mana ability has spending restrictions to keep in flavor. You can only spend this mana on things that actually live in this canvas.
    - The destruction of this canvas signals the erasure of everything inside it. Mass exiling everything by expansion filter nicely symbolizes the finality of such an act.
