[DesignNotes]
 - In the game this is one of Lune's abilities.
 - As the ability from the game has fire/ice elements, it naturally mechanically maps to a tap and stun on the ice side. For the fire side, I've decided to add a creature bolt ability behind a kicker cost.
[Bugs]
AI seems to be able to tap+stun two targets instead of tap+stun (0...1) target creature and bolt another (0...1) target creature
