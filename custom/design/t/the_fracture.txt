[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, The Fracture is a cataclysmic event which marks the appearance of The Monolith and sets in motion the annual yearly gommage.
 - Mechanically, this event itself is only catalclysmic in terms of the continent landscape, while there may have been human casualties in this event, this event was more about the altered landscape of the continent, thus it is clear that this event should be a non-basic land mass destruction effect like Ruination (non-basic so it doesn't become a strictly better Armageddon and to reward players who play basic lands).
     - The tutoring effect for The Monolith thematically maps to the appearance of The Monolith in the game.
