The Monolith enters with 10 gommage counters.
At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a gommage counter, then exile all non-land, non-legendary permanents with mana value greater than or equal to the number of gommage counters on The Monolith.
When The Monolith has no gommage counters on it, sacrifice it.
