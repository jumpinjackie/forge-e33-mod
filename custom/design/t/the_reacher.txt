[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, The Reacher is an Act 3 dungeon. It is also one of the four Axons created by Renoir and represents Alicia.
 - The Reacher is a landmark, but also an Axon. So in MTG terms, it's both a land and a creature.
 - To make something uniquely different from The Hauler (which is a man-land). I've gone with a legendary land creature, following the pattern of Dryad Arbor.
 - Now how do we balance out an 8/8 trampling uncounterable Axon that could drop on turn 1? We take a page out of Dark Depths and have this ETB with 7 sky counters. While it has sky counters, it cannot attack or block and is effectively dormant as a creature. You can still use it as a regular U/G dual land until you've remove the last sky counter.
