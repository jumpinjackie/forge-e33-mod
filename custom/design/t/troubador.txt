[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, a Troubador uses its horn to buff the enemy party.
 - Mechanically, I've mapped this to a basic nevron lord buff effect.
 - 21/10/2025: Added lord haste effect to match its character sheet.
 - 26/10/2025: Made it red/green in line with the buffs it gives out.
 - 17/11/2025: Changed mana cost from 2(R/G) to 1RG
