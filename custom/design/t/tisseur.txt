[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Tisseur is an optional boss in Sirène's Coliseum. Defeating it will make the upcoming boss fight against Sirène much easier.
 - Made it an artifact creature as it clearly has artificial instead of organic nature. It looks like a thread spindle with a head and arms attached to it. Nothing organic about that!
 - Has reach as I view Tisseur weaving fabric the same way a spider (a classic creature that always has reach) weaves webs.
 - Main gimmick I'm translating is its cursing ability which I'm translating it to putting "you are getting sacced next upkeep" counters on creatures.
