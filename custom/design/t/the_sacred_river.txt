[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the Sacred River is a place where Gestrals can be resurrected.
 - Per game lore and rules established by Golgra, you need to be "in a queue" to get a Gestral resurrection, but if you're in favor with Golgra you could get a discount and "jump the queue". So I've gone with a regrowth ability with a discount if you have Golgra on the battlefield.
