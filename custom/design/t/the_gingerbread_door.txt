[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, The Gingerbread Door is an obstacle in Verso's Drafts. It can only be unlocked by presenting it a birthday cake. The birthday cake is composed from 3 cake slices which can be acquired from completing various tasks.
 - It's made of Gingerbread so clearly it's a Food.
 - It's an obstacle so it's clearly an artifact of the Ensnaring Bridge kind.
 - Instead of counting cards in hand, we count foods on the battlefield (to flavorfully approximate the "you need 3 slices of cake to unlock this door" condition)
 - To give opponents a fighting chance with this in play, a food token is granted on ETB to each player. That way combat is not hard-locked out. 1/2-power creatures can still swing for the fences, but they could be swinging into fatties that can't currently attack, so there's a fine balancing act at play.
