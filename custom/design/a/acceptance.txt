[DesignNotes]
 - No in-game basis, but Grief is such a central theme of Expedition 33 that having a cycle dedicated to the 5 stages is a total flavor nuke.
 - I'm taking the word Acceptance literally (or is it figuratively?) and gone with a creature that "accepts" all damage that would've gone your way.
 - 28/12/2025: Made shield counter ability require a tap in its activation cost.
