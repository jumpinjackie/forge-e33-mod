Suspend 1 - {U}{R} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, pay {U}{R} and exile it with one time counter on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, you may cast it without paying its mana cost.)
This spell deals 3 damage to any target.
Create a Lumina token.
