Verso: We only need to incapacitate him.
Maelle: We'll find a way to kill him.
[DesignNotes]
 - No in-game basis, but Grief is such a central theme of Expedition 33 that having a cycle dedicated to the 5 stages is a total flavor nuke.
 - Since we've gone with a cycle of 5 stages and Anger's already taken, let's just reuse that reprint.
