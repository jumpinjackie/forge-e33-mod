[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, after slaying the first of two Axons, a cutscene plays at camp where its heart is offered by Lune to The Curator, but he insists that Maelle do the offering instead.
 - Gone with an Innocent Blood mutual creature sac effect, but with a Chroma bonus (as a "reward" for the sacrifice)
