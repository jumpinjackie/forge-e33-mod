[DesignNotes]
 - Gone with a targeted (Null Rod / Cursed Totem) effect to mechanically emphasize the "silence"
 - The real gimmick is melding with Maelle, Child of Lumiere. Meld is 100% the mechanic to sell the transformation
    - 23/09/2025: Getting meld to work has been nothing but failure. I give up. Alicia will now be standalone.
 - 6/10/2025: Meld is back on the menu! Got it to work finally! Also extended null rod effect to Chroma and Lumina tokens.
 - 3/11/2025: Exchanged abilities with human Alicia. Canonist exemption changed from Nevrons/Gradient to Painters/Gradient. Reduce Chroma sac activation cost from 3 to 2 tokens.
 - 12/11/2025: Dropped the silencing activated ability as it makes no thematic sense to pay in tokens that don't exist in the "real world" that Alicia is in. Using straight mana payment then raises game balancing concerns around what is the appropriate cost. Better to just drop the ability.
