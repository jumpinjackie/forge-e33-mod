At the beginning of your upkeep, you may put a verse counter on ~.
{T}: Add {C}.
{T}, Remove two verse counters from ~: Expeditioner creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.
[FlavorText]
Maybe when this is over, we can fix up the opera house and you can perform for us. I want my first concert to be yours. And don't worry, I'll make sure the room is packed. I'll put up posters everywhere in town.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, in Maelle's ending. Verso plays piano at the Lumière Opera House (forever and ever?)
 - Mechanically speaking, music generally translates to creature buffs (see almost any "Anthem" card printed), so I went with a land that grows verse counters that can be spent to momentarily buff your force.
