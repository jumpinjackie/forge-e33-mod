[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Painted Alicia hands a letter to Verso to be delivered to Maelle, but at the conclusion of Act 2 he opens it and reads it for himself, revealing the true intentions of The Paintress that the party had just defeated.
 - Given the letter is about Painted Alicia's desire for this conflict to end, I've mapped this to a momentary "peacekeeper" effect.
 - A letter follows the archetype of a Clue Artifact, thus it's a clue.
