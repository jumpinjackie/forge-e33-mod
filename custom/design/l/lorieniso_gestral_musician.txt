[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Lorieniso is one of the NPCs found in the Gestral Village. Clearly named after Lorien Testard, the composer of the OST for this game.
 - This is the Gestral's Goblin Matron / Gestral Tutor. Adapted from Yisan, the Wanderer Bard
 - 20/09/2025: Initial playtesting shows this is quite broken in multiples. Made into a legendary creature and changed P/T to 1/3
