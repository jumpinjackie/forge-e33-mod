Tree of Life — {W}{G}, {T}, Remove a stain counter from Lune: Return target nonland, noncreature card from your graveyard to your hand. You gain 3 life.
Wildfire — {R}, {T}, Remove two stain counters from Lune: Lune deals 2 damage to each creature target opponent controls.

[DesignNotes]
 - This was one of the hardest cards to design because Lune is a veritable "Jack of all trades" in terms of abilities in-game. Also we have to somehow emulate her stain gimmick in a way that doesn't look too out of flavor.
 - So in this respect, this is what I went with:
    - The stain gimmick is a triggered ability that gives you stain counters for the colors of any instant/sorcery cast.
        - The original intent was to have 4 different types of stain counters to match the colors of any instants/sorceries resolved. (eg. Resolve a blue spell, add a blue stain counter, etc). Her abilities would then be activated by spending the appropriate type of stain counters. But that is just too much text and we don't have the textbox budget for it!
        - The stain counters being "colorless" but an amount given based on the colors of the instant/sorcery cast was a compromise to save on text.
        - The second compromise is to spend stain counters + a mana of a particular color for a color-relevant ability.
    - In terms of abilities, we've made sure that every color in Lune's color identity is covered.
        - Blue: Draw a card from cast trigger.
        - Red: The Wildfire ability
        - Green/White: The Tree of Life ability
    - The Elemental Genesis "ultimate" requires no extra mana cost because getting to 4 stain counters is enough investment already.
 - 26/12/2025: Figured out a way to implement a max 4 stain counter limit to match her video game counterpart. Due to limitations on expressing this "4 stain counters max" constraint in Forge, I expect that this limit can be easily cicumvented through other means in Forge (ie. Alternate ways of putting stain counters that are not Lune's triggered ability) and I can live with that. The intent in *paper* play is definitely 4 stain counters max, no ifs or buts. No shenanigans with Doubling Season or other counter replicators.
