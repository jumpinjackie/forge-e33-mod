[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Gustave lead the Aquafarm project which ensured the food supply for the city of Lumiere.
 - This gives us an opportunity to add another dual land to this set.
 - Obviously expeditioner aligned so they get a ETB tapped sidestep.
 - It's a farm so obviously needs a Food token generating ability.
