[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Licornapieds is an optional boss in Verso's Drafts. They have the appearance of a Licorne fused wtih a Machinepieds.
 - The ability suite is very similar to that of Dominique Giant Feet, so has the same abilities but with adjusted costs plus a Barbapapa debuff ETB + Trample + Double Strike
