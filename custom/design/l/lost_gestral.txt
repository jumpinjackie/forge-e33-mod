When this creature enters, if you control a card named Sastro, the Concerned, create 2 Chroma tokens.
Whenever this creature becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, put this creature on the bottom of its owner's library.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, there is a side-quest where you have to find a bunch of Lost Gestrals and return them to Sastro. Every Lost Gestral you find and return to Sastro gives you rewards. For the first ability I went with rewarding the player with Chroma tokens if Sastro is in play when a Lost Gestral enters as a mechanical analogy to this side quest.
 - The second ability was taken from Fblthp, the Lost to mechanically explain why these Gestrals keep getting lost.
