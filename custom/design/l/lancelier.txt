[DesignNotes]
 - Another generic vanilla Nevron to round out the creature roster for limited/draft.
 - In game, Lancelier's wield a lance. So clearly this should have First Strike.
 - 23/09/2025: Now green instead of white/green. White Nevrons will be their own unique sub-race that we don't want regular Nevrons to bleed into.
 - 5/10/2025: Added missing Devoid.
 - 13/10/2025: Removed Devoid.
