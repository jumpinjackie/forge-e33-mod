Did I mention the prize is a powerful weapon? So, how about it?

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Limonsol sets up fights in the Gestral Arena
 - Mechanically, I just repeated Gestral Arena and gave him a fight ability
 - 27/11/2025: Dropped Gestral restriction to reduce parasitism. Limonsol doesn't discriminate against any participant!
