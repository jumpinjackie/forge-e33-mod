As this enchantment enters, choose a creature type.
Whenever a creature you control of the chosen type enters, target creature you control of the chosen type with greater mana value gains haste until end of turn.
Whenever two or more creatures of the chosen type attacks, they each get +1/+0 until end of turn.
[FlavorText]
Verso traded his life for yours. I both love and hate him for that. That damn fool.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, inside Verso's Treehouse in Verso's Drafts, there are various artpieces depicting Verso interacting with various family members. One of them is him watching his older sister Clea painting, presumably waiting for her to finish so they can go play in his canvas.
 - Mapped as follows:
    - A creature entering grants a creature with higher MV haste, being my mechanical interpretation of a younger sibling waiting for an elder sibling to be ready.
    - Two or more attacking creatures of the same kind getting attack buff being my mechanical interpretation of siblings playing.
