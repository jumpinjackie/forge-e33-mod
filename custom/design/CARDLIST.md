# About

This is our master card name list. All ideas and card designs start from a card name. Card names can come from any source in Expedition 33:

 * It could refer to a character in the game
    * eg. Gustave, Lumiere Engineer
 * It could refer to an ability/skill of one of the party characters or enemies
    * eg. Earth Rising
 * It could refer to an item in the game or an item possessed by one of the party characters
    * eg. Gustave's Journal, Energy Tint.
 * It could refer to landmark/location in the game
    * eg. The Monolith, Gestral Village
 * It could refer to a quote said by a character
    * eg. An Advantage!
 * It could refer to an event that took place in the game
    * eg. The Fracture
 * It could refer to something mentioned in the game, but not actually depicted in game
    * eg. Expedition 60
 * Where none of the above applies, and we need a specific card to fill out a particular slot or role in the set, a card name could be something that could *plausibly* exist or happen in the world depicted by the game
    * eg. Lune's Denial, Nevron Pecking Order, Expedition Recruiter
 * When all else fails and a reprint slot cannot fill the gap, we can fall back some set-agnostic name.
    * No examples yet as we haven't needed to dip to this level yet

As new card name ideas come to fruition, this list will be updated.

Un-implemented card names may be removed at any time if it is deemed that we cannot make a card design from that name.

From this list, card designs are spawned from it, which will eventually form the final card script and CardConjurer config.

## Quotes deserving of a card name + design

So far, we've been compiling a list of tentative card names to make designs from, but this is the opposite approach where we have quotes that are so good or relevant, that they are begging for a card with it as its flavor text. Here's a bunch of quotes deserving of a card name + design.

> Prologue
> Gustave: We'll break the cycle. So she can't steal anyone else's future.

No ideas yet.

> Prologue
> Sophie: Sometimes I feel sorry for her.
> Gustave: Who, the- the Paintress??
> Sophie: Look at her. She looks... sad. Maybe she's a prisoner too. Stuck in the same cycle with us.

No ideas yet.

> Prologue
> Sophie: See you.
> Maelle: In the next life.

No ideas yet.

> Act 1
> Lune: You do that and we both die

No ideas yet.

> Act 2: Visages
> Sciel: I know they're Nevrons, but... witnessing the sorrow of others... I can't help but feel for them.
> Monoco: A noble but tremendously fatal impulse

No ideas yet.

> Act 2: Visages
> Monoco: Normally I enjoy a little destruction, but this doesn't feel right

No ideas yet.

> Act 2: Mask-Keeper battle
> Sciel: This mask can't hurt me. Because it is me.

No ideas yet.

> Act 2: Camp
> Verso: My beautiful sister doesn't need this ugly mask.

Reprint of Unmask?

> Act 2: Camp
> Renoir: You embrace her, yet you are condeming her to die.

No ideas yet.

> The Manor
> Unknown: Art can be a Window and art can be a Mirror. And great art. Great art is both. Son, you'll never be a true artist if there's always a mask between you and the viewer, especially when the viewer is you...

Reprint of Mirror Gallery? It would be the most flavorful, but also quite useless in cube ro commander paper play since there will only ever be 1 copy of anything anyways.

> Act 2: Monolith Interior
> Renoir: If saving you means losing you then so be it.

No ideas yet.

> Act 2: Renoir boss battle
> Renoir: WE are your family. You would condemn us all to die, for what? Who do you really save with your sacrifice?

No ideas yet.

> Act 3: Lumiere post-gommage. Renoir, after Curator transformation.
> Renoir: I know it seems absurd to offer oblivion as recompense, but perhaps that's the outcome we both desire.

This the *IDEAL* flavor text for Choice of Damnations, if it didn't have the parisitic Arcane sub-type, but who are we to judge? We're doing the same thing too! So maybe we just have thematically adjusted reprint.

> Act 3: Before final boss battle with Renoir
> Renoir: As your father, I must look out for you. Especially when you can't look out for yourself.

Sounds like an instant that grants protection until end of turn.

> Act 3: Before final boss battle with Renoir
> Maelle: You treat me as if I'm still five...
> Renoir: I treat you as if the shadow from the worst day of our lives is going to suffocate you and take you from us too.

Something to do with the "suffocation". 

> Act 3: During final boss battle with Renoir
> Renoir: Stop this insanity. It's time to go home.

No ideas yet.

> Act 3: Renoir final boss battle post-script
> Renoir: We painted hundreds of Canvas worlds, pushing the very boundaries of creation. And she never let me forget that every day we spend here has a price.

Sounds like some black enchantment that trades life for resources

> Act 3: Renoir final boss battle post-script
> Renoir: I'll keep the light on for you. I hope you find peace. Hold on to each other.

Something that signifies departure.
