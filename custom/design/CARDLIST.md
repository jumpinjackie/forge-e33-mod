# About

This is our master card name list. All ideas and card designs start from a card name. Card names can come from any source in Expedition 33:

 * It could refer to a character in the game
    * eg. Gustave, Lumière Engineer
 * It could refer to an ability/skill of one of the party characters or enemies
    * eg. Earth Rising
 * It could refer to an item in the game or an item possessed by one of the party characters
    * eg. Gustave's Journal, Energy Tint.
 * It could refer to landmark/location in the game
    * eg. The Monolith, Gestral Village
 * It could refer to a quote said by a character
    * eg. An Advantage!
 * It could refer to an event that took place in the game
    * eg. The Fracture
 * It could refer to something mentioned in the game, but not actually depicted in game
    * eg. Expedition 60
 * Where none of the above applies, and we need a specific card to fill out a particular slot or role in the set, a card name could be something that could *plausibly* exist or happen in the world depicted by the game
    * eg. Lune's Denial, Nevron Pecking Order, Expedition Recruiter
 * When all else fails and a reprint slot cannot fill the gap, we can fall back some set-agnostic name.
    * No examples yet as we haven't needed to dip to this level yet

As new card name ideas come to fruition, this list will be updated.

Un-implemented card names may be removed at any time if it is deemed that we cannot make a card design from that name.

From this list, card designs are spawned from it, which will eventually form the final card script and CardConjurer config.

## Quotes deserving of a card name + design

So far, we've been compiling a list of tentative card names to make designs from, but this is the opposite approach where we have quotes that are so good or relevant, that they are begging for a card with it as its flavor text. Here's a bunch of quotes deserving of a card name + design.

> Prologue
> Gustave: We'll break the cycle. So she can't steal anyone else's future.

No ideas yet.

> Prologue
> Sophie: Sometimes I feel sorry for her.
> Gustave: Who, the- the Paintress??
> Sophie: Look at her. She looks... sad. Maybe she's a prisoner too. Stuck in the same cycle with us.

No ideas yet.

> Prologue
> Sophie: See you.
> Maelle: In the next life.

No ideas yet.

> Act 1
> Lune: You do that and we both die

No ideas yet.

> Act 2: Visages
> Monoco: Normally I enjoy a little destruction, but this doesn't feel right

No ideas yet.

> Act 2: Camp
> Renoir: You embrace her, yet you are condeming her to die.

No ideas yet.

> Act 2: Monolith Interior
> Renoir: If saving you means losing you then so be it.

No ideas yet.

> Act 2: Renoir boss battle
> Renoir: WE are your family. You would condemn us all to die, for what? Who do you really save with your sacrifice?

Some card centered around betrayal or switching allegiance.

> Act 3: Lumière post-gommage. Renoir, after Curator transformation.
> Renoir: I know it seems absurd to offer oblivion as recompense, but perhaps that's the outcome we both desire.

This the *IDEAL* flavor text for Choice of Damnations, if it didn't have the parisitic Arcane sub-type, but who are we to judge? We're doing the same thing too! So maybe we just have thematically adjusted reprint.

> Act 3: Before final boss battle with Renoir
> Maelle: You treat me as if I'm still five...
> Renoir: I treat you as if the shadow from the worst day of our lives is going to suffocate you and take you from us too.

Something to do with the "suffocation". 

> Act 3: During final boss battle with Renoir
> Renoir: Stop this insanity. It's time to go home.

No ideas yet.
