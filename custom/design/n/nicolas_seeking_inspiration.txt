{T}, Sacrifice a Chroma token: Draw a card.
$EXPEDITIONER_DEATH_ABILITY_TEXT
[FlavorText]
I know, how about showing me a dance of love and sorrow? I am also the official painter of the Opera. Will you help me? If you inspire me, you may become the main painting of Lumière’s Opera.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game's prologue, Nicolas (if spoken to) asks you (Gustave) do dodge Sophie's attacks to inspire him with this painting. This is really just a thinly veiled tutorial on dodging attacks.
 - Mapped inspiration to saccing chroma tokens (Chroma being the "paint/lifeforce" of this world) for card draw.
