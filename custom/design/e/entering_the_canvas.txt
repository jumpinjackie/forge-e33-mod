[DesignNotes]
 - This symbolizes the moment in the game where real Alicia enters Verso's canvas to try and help real Renoir in expelling Aline out of the canvas, but ends up being consumed by Aline's chroma and is "reborn" as Maelle.
 - Mechanically/thematically translated to near carbon copy of Through the Breach.
