[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 78 stole hundreds of airships from the Lumiere Council and departed to take on the Paintress. The Expedition failed, but the fate of the expeditioners is unknown.
 - Card represents some of the Airship crew.
 - This is our heavy-hitter for an all-flyers strategy.
