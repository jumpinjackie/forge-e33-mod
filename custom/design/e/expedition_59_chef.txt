Whenever a Nevron creature dies, create a Food token.
Sacrifice a Food token: Target creature deals 3 damage to itself.
When this creature dies, create a Chroma token.
[FlavorText]
I can't believe she convinced everyone to eat the Nevron. They've been puking for the past few hours. Great.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 59 attempted to eat dead Nevrons for sustenance.
 - This card represents the genius who suggested such an idea.
 - Has strong mechanical similarity to Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar so has the same "food poisoning" ability.
