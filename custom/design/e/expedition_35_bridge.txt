[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 35 perished to Nevrons in Falling Leaves. In their final moments, as they were becoming petrified, they threw themselves on top of each other to form a bridge for future expeditions to cross.
 - I've symbolized this as an enchantment where Expeditioners can be sacrificed for card draw, since each Expeditioner creature has a Chroma token death bonus, this can potentially be a combo engine to rip through your deck for some game winning payoff.
 - 26/10/2025: Added creature sac for scry ability to avoid parasitism.
