When this creature leaves the battlefield, investigate (Create a Clue token. It’s an artifact with “{2}, Sacrifice this token: Draw a card.”)
This creature gets +2/+2 as long as it’s un-modified. (Equipment, Auras you control, and counters are modifications.)

One last swim separates me from Lumière, but even with my mighty muscles, I don’t know if I can outswim the Gommage.

$EXPEDITIONER_DEATH_ABILITY
[DesignNotes]
 - Depicts the member of the gigachad expedition that almost made it back to Lumière to relay the message about the true enemy.
 - The clue token left behind represents the expedition journal.
 - Has un-modified buffs because these gigachads don't require pithy things like clothing and armor.
