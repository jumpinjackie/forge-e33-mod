[FlavorText]
I still remember the first mountain we scaled. Watching the sun rise above the clouds was magical. But rappelling down as we set the handholds was pure exhilaration.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 69 were responsible for most of the grappling points installed throughout the continent. Obviously then, members of this expeditions have a strong exploration theme.
 - For this card, instead of a mana/land ramp theme I've gone with a variant of Treetop Rangers / Silhana Ledgewalker. With such experience in climbing, this creature clearly isn't grounded and thus can only be engaged with in combat by flyers.
