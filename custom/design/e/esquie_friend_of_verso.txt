Saddle 2.
Esquie has Islandwalk as long as you control a card named Florrie.
Esquie has Flying as long as you control a card named Soarrie.
Esquie has Trample as long as you control a card named Dorrie.
When Esquie attacks, if you control a card named Urrie, Surveil 2.
When Esquie attacks, if it is saddled, choose one:
 - Draw a card.
 - Put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Esquie is the character the rest of the party rides on to travel across the Continent overworld.
 - In the game, Esquie gains additional powers through consuming the rocks, Florrie (swimming), Dorrie (smash thorugh coral barriers), Soarrie (flying) and Urrie (diving)
 - Mechanically, it makes 100% sense this should be a Mount artifact creature with Saddle
     - Because I want to enable an "Urzatron" strategy with the 4 legendary rocks, I am deviating from lore by having these 4 rocks grant extra abilities to Esquie when on the battlefield instead of sacrificing them to Esquie to give them these abilities
     - Mechanically I've interpreted Esquies abilities as:
         - Swimming - Islandwalk
         - Smashing through coral barriers - Trample
         - Flying - Flying
         - Diving - Surveil on attack
 - Because this is a Mount creature with Saddle, I've given it the Uro (draw a card or put a land) triggered ability as the saddle attacking bonus.

Getting the same ordering issue on the Uro modal trigger as Golgra.
