[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Esquie is the character the rest of the party rides on to travel across the Continent overworld.
 - In the game, Esquie gains additional powers through consuming the rocks, Florrie (swimming), Dorrie (smash thorugh coral barriers), Soarrie (flying) and Urrie (diving)
 - Mechanically, it makes 100% sense this should be a Mount artifact creature with Saddle
    - Because I want to enable an "Urzatron" strategy with the 4 legendary rocks, I am deviating from lore by having these 4 rocks grant extra abilities to Esquie when on the battlefield instead of sacrificing them to Esquie to give them these abilities
    - Mechanically I've interpreted Esquies abilities as:
        - Swimming - Islandwalk
        - Smashing through coral barriers - Trample
        - Flying - Flying
        - Diving - Surveil on attack
 - Because this is a Mount creature with Saddle, I've given it the Uro (draw a card or put a land) triggered ability as the saddle attacking bonus.
