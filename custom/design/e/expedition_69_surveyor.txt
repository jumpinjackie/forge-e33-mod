When this creature enters, you may search your library for a basic land card, put that card onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle.
Whenever this creature attacks, surveil 1.
When this creature dies, create a Chroma token.

I get it's not very satisfying making maps and prepping trails while people are dying, but this prep work will pay off in the long run. - Fleur
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 69 were responsible for most of the grappling points installed throughout the continent. Obviously then, members of this expeditions have a strong exploration theme.
 - For this card, I've gone with a land ramp effect with a surveil attack trigger to sell the Surveyor > Surveiling.
