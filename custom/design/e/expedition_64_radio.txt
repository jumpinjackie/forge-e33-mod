[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 64 used radio communications to keep in touch. The expedition started to collapse and eventually fail when their radio communications broke down.
 - I've interpreted the radio device as an artifact that has a ringleader effect when it ETBs to represent "calling for backup"
