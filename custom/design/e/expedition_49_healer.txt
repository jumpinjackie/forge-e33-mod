For our allies who come after, sadly our lives may have proven that defense is both absolutely necessary and wholly insufficient.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 49 employed strong defensive and healing tactics against Nevrons which proved ineffective as their offensive capabilities were really weak.
 - Easy mechanical map to a creature with life gain and damage prevention abilities.
