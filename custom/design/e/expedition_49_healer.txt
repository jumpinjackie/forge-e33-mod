Whenever you create a Chroma or Lumina token, you gain 1 life.
{2}, {T}: Prevent the next X damage that would be dealt to any target this turn, where X is the number of Chroma and Lumina tokens you control.
When this creature dies, create a Chroma token.
[FlavorText]
For our allies who come after, sadly our lives may have proven that defense is both absolutely necessary and wholly insufficient.

[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Expedition 49 employed strong defensive and healing tactics against Nevrons which proved ineffective as their offensive capabilities were really weak.
 - Easy mechanical map to a creature with life gain and damage prevention abilities.
