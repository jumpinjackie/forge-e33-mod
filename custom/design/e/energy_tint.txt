[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, Energy Tints help refill your party's AP during a battle or outside of battle when you're not near an Expedition flag.
 - Just a mana rock for this set.
 - Yes it may look dangerous to have a Grim Monolith with no downside, but you need some Lumina token investment first to take advantage, so there is some setup involved. The ideal turn 1 An Advantage!, turn 2 Energy Tint line is something I can accept as variance.
