[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, the journal of Expedition 40 details the story of trying to enter The Monolith by flying through the barrier. Those who tried got gommaged.
 - This card represents the poor bastards who tried.
 - I basically copied Rishadan Airship and stapled the Chroma death bonus to it.
