{T}: Add one mana of any type that a land you control could produce.
{T}: Add {W}{U}{B}{R}{G}. Activate this ability only if you control a card named Soarrie, a card named Florrie, a card named Dorrie and a card named Urrie.
[DesignNotes]
 - In the game, this is the place where Esquie dwells.
 - Esquie's Nest visually resembles most artistic depictions of the card Reflecting Pool, so I gave it the same mana ability.
 - I've gone with making this card one of the beneficiaries of the "Urzatron" rock strategy.

[Bugs]
The WUBRG mana ability is not preventatively disabled if you don't meet the activation condition. The ability however will (correctly) not add WUBRG if you don't meet the activation condition.
