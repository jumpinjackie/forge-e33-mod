[DesignNotes]
 - In the game's prologue, Sophie hands Gustave an Expeditioner uniform she made. She wants to see him wearing the uniform before the Gommage.
 - Gone with an equipment that applies type-changing and mild buffs if the wearer is a human. Also has an explore attack trigger, to go with the expedition/exploration theme.
