# HACK: GainControl does not fizzle if the creature died at this point. It gets reanimated and control transfers to opponent!
# I am taking a page out of Chaos Lord which also has conditional control transfer and have to do this SVar check as a workaround to ensure it fizzles if it's dead at this point.
