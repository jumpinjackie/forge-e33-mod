# forge-e33-mod

This a mod for [Forge](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge) based on the video game [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/).

This mod is multi-faceted and consists of:

 * [Current Focus] A new custom expansion set with cards inspired by the lore, story, flavor, characters and mechanics from the video game.
 * A music mod to replace the built-in menu/battle music with a curated selection of tracks from the video game OST.
 * [Maybe in the future, if I'm still motivated] A custom [quest mode](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge?tab=readme-ov-file#-quest-modes) focused solely on the enemies and bosses of Expedition 33 with decks only from this custom set.
 * [In the long distant future maybe, if I'm really really motivated] A custom [adventure mode](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge?tab=readme-ov-file#-adventure-mode) plane focused solely on the world, enemies and bosses of Expedition 33 with decks only from this custom set.
