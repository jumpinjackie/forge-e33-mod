# Cards

## Chroma Prison

```
2W
Kindred Enchantment - Nevron
If you control a Nevron or Painter, you may cast this spell as though it had flash.
When this enchantment enters, exile another target nonland permanent.
When this enchantment leaves the battlefield, return the exiled card to the battlefield under its owner's control.
```

### Design Notes

 - Oblivion Ring variant #234898572343
 - This represents the barrier that Painted Renoir traps Maelle in at the Stone Wave Cliffs.
 - Gave it Nevron/Painter affiliated bonuses

## Clair

```
2W
Creature - Nevron
Devoid (This card has no color.)
When this creature dies, target opponent creates a Lumina token.
{2}{W},{T}: Target creature an opponent controls loses all abilities until end of turn.
{1}{W},{T}: Put a shield counter on target creature you control.

2/2
```

### Design Notes

 - In the game, it has abilities to shield its party and cause silence to player characters.
 - Mechanically represented here as:
    - Granting shield counters
    - A temporary "humility" effect to represent silencing.


## Repaint

```
1W
Sorcery
As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice X Chromas. Return target card from exile with mana value X to your hand, where X is the number of sacrificed Chromas.
```

### Design Notes

 - This is meant to represent (paintress) Maelle's new-found ability to resurrect the citizens of Lumiere provided she has some of their Chroma, as demonstrated by being able to bring back Lune and Sciel after their gommage.
 - Mechanically this means we can also bring back cards from exile.
 - Currently not working (the sacrifice X chromas condition). See BUGS.md

## Sciel's Intervention

```
1W
Kindred Instant - Expeditioner
Untap target creature you control. It gains hexproof until end of turn.
```

### Design Notes

 - In the game, Intervention is Sciel's ability that lets an ally take their turn immediately along with an AP boost
 - Mechanically, we've mapped "granting extra turns" to untapping creatures. Nothing approximates an "AP boost" for creatures, so we've given it a granting of hexproof.
 - This has the name of "Sciel's Intervention" as "Intervention" on its own has a risk of being "name-squatted" by an actual card from Wizards in the future.

## The Fracture

```
3W
Legendary Sorcery
(You may cast a legendary sorcery only if you control a legendary creature or planeswalker.)
Destroy all non-basic lands. Search your library for a card named The Monolith, put it onto the battlefield and shuffle.
```

### Design Notes

 - In the game, The Fracture is a cataclysmic event which marks the appearance of The Monolith and sets in motion the annual yearly gommage.
 - Mechanically, this event itself is only catalclysmic in terms of the continent landscape, while there may have been human casualties in this event, this event was more about the altered landscape of the continent, thus it is clear that this event should be a non-basic land mass destruction effect like Ruination (non-basic so it doesn't become a strictly better Armageddon and to reward players who play basic lands).
     - The tutoring effect for The Monolith thematically maps to the appearance of The Monolith in the game.
