# About

This is our master card name list. All ideas and card designs start from a card name. Card names can come from any source in Expedition 33:

 * It could refer to a character in the game
    * eg. Gustave, Lumiere Engineer
 * It could refer to an ability/skill of one of the party characters or enemies
    * eg. Earth Rising
 * It could refer to an item in the game or an item possessed by one of the party characters
    * eg. Gustave's Journal, Energy Tint.
 * It could refer to landmark/location in the game
    * eg. The Monolith, Gestral Village
 * It could refer to a quote said by a character
    * eg. An Advantage!
 * It could refer to an event that took place in the game
    * eg. The Fracture
 * It could refer to something mentioned in the game, but not actually depicted in game
    * eg. Expedition 60
 * Where none of the above applies, and we need a specific card to fill out a particular slot or role in the set, a card name could be something that could *plausibly* exist or happen in the world depicted by the game
    * eg. Lune's Denial, Nevron Pecking Order, Expedition Recruiter
 * When all else fails and a reprint slot cannot fill the gap, we can fall back some set-agnostic name.
    * No examples yet as we haven't needed to dip to this level yet

As new card name ideas come to fruition, this list will be updated.

Un-implemented card names may be removed at any time if it is deemed that we cannot make a card design from that name.

From this list, card designs are spawned from it, which will eventually form the final card script and CardConjurer config.
