```

[card implementation](/custom/cards/a/abbest.txt)

### Design Notes

 - Just a "vanilla" bear with stock Nevron card text.


## Expedition 69

```
2G
Enchantment - Saga
(As this Saga enters and after your draw step, add a lore counter. Sacrifice after III.)
I — Search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle.
II — You may play an additional land thus turn.
III — Search your library for a land card, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle.
```

### Design Notes

 - Journal is thematically the same as Expedition 69: a story of exploring everywhere and installing grapple points for those who come after.
 - The one puts more emphasis on the exploration (ie. Land/mana ramp)

## Revitalization

```
2G
Sorcery
Choose up to one target creature and up to one target non-creature card in your graveyard. Return them to your hand.
```

### Design Notes

 - In the game, this is Lune's healing ability.
 - No mechanical relation. We've just re-approriated the name for a green regrowth-style spell.
