# Set code

E33 or EXP

# Lands

Lumiere
Legendary Land - Town

 T: Add {W}
 {1}{W},T: Create a 1/1 White Human Expeditioner token with "When this creature dies or is exiled, create a Chroma token"
 {1}{W},T: Create a Map token

Lumiere Opera House
Legendary Land

Old Lumiere
Legendary Land

Flying Manor
Legendary Land

Flying Waters
Land

 T: Add {U}
 {U},T: Target creature you control gains flying until end of turn

Stone Wave Cliffs
Land

 

Dark Shores
Land

 This card enters tapped unless you control a Nevron
 T: Add {B}. If you control a Nevron, add {B}{B} instead and put a stun counter on this card.

Forgotten Battlefield
Legendary Land

 T: Add {C}
 {1}{B},T: Put target Nevron card from your graveyard on top of your library
 
- Basically Volrath's Stronghold for Nevrons

Gestral Village
Land - Town

 T: Add {C}
 T: Add {C}{C}. Spend this mana only to play a Gestral spell

- Basically Eldrazi Temple for Gestrals

Gestral Beach
Land

 T: Add {C}
 Cycling: {2}
 Cycling: {1}. Activate this ability only if you control a Gestral creature.

Gestral Arena
Land

 T: Add {C}
 {1}{R/G},T: Target Gestral you control fights another target creature

The Reacher
 - The Reacher is all about verticality (reaching for the skies). How do we mechanically represent that?

Endless Tower
Legendary Land

 At the beginning of your upkeep, you may put a challenge counter on this card.
 T: Add {C}
 T, Remove X challenge counters from this card: Put a Nevron creature with mana value X or less from your hand into play.

Monoco's Station
Land

 T: Add {C}
 T: Add {U} or {R}. Activate this ability only if you control a Gestral.
 T: Add {U} or {R}. Put a stun counter on this card.

The Monolith Interior
Land

 You may have this land enter as a copy of any non-basic land on the battlefield, except it has “At the beginning of your upkeep, you may have this land become a copy of target non-basic land, except it has this ability.”

- Basically a Vesuvan Doppelganger for lands. Meant to mechanically capture the Paintress' memories of places visited by Expedition 33

The Monolith
Legendary Land

 When this card enters. Exile all Aline Planeswalkers until this card leaves the battlefield.
 While this card is in play, plays cannot cast Aline Planeswalker spells.
 This card enters with 10 gommage counters.
 At the beginnning of your upkeep, remove a gommage counter from this card, then exile all nonland, non-legendary permanents with mana value greater than or equal to the number of gommage counters on this card.
 When this card has no gommage counters, sacrifice it.
 T: Add {C}
 
 - For lore accuracy, this would've been 100 counters instead of 10, but that would take way too long in MTG "game time". Reducing it to 10 sacrifices lore accuracy, but retains mechanical accuracy.
 - Exile/blocking effect meant to symbolize Aline being trapped in the Monolith.

Renoir's Drafts
Land

 When this card enters. Exile all Renoir Planeswalkers until this card leaves the battlefield.
 While this card is in play, players cannot cast Renoir Planeswalker spells.
 T: Add {U} or {B}
 {2}, Sacrifice this land: Draw a card
 
 - Exile/blocking effect meant to symbolize Renoir being trapped underneath the Monolith.

Crushing Cavern
Land

This land enters tapped

 T: Add {C}
 T, Sacrifice this card: Destroy target attacking creature without flying
 
- Having this enter tapped so any creature can at least get one shot in before this land could kill it

Sacred River
Legendary Land

 T: Add {C}
 {X},T: Put target Gestral card from your graveyard or exile with mana value X into play tapped. This ability costs {3} less if you control a card named Golgra

- Per lore, you need to be "in a queue" to get a Gestral resurrection, but if you're in favor with Golgra you could get a discount and "jump the queue"

# Expedition Journals

Journals can be Sagas. Doesn't have to cover every expedition, just the most notable ones or ones whose synopsis or overarching theme is translatable to MTG mechanics.

Expedition 60
 - Color Identity: Gruul
 - Chapter 1: Un-modified creatures you control gain haste and double strike until end of turn (something that emphasises power of raw human strength)
 - Chapter 2: Un-modified creatures you control gain hexproof until end of turn (closest analogue I could find to gommage barrier immunity)
 - Chapter 3: Un-modified creatures you control gain trample and +3/+3 until end of turn
 - May need to tweak definition. Modern MTG templating would grant such abilities through ability counters which is a nonbo with un-modified creatures. Making buffs temporary would sidestep this issue.
    - Journal is a story of expeditioners who almost succeeded in their mission through raw human strength

Expedition 63
 - Color Identity: Izzet
 - Chapter 1,2: You may crew a vehicle by tapping a creature with power 1 instead of its regular crew cost
 - Chapter 3: Sacrifice all vehicles you control. For each vehicle sacrificed, you may have it deal damage to target creature or planeswalker equal to the sacrified vehicle's mana value
    - Journal is a story of expeditioners using cars to traverse the continent only for their mission to end when they fatally crashed into some Nevrons
 
Expedition 68
 - Color Identity: Blue
 - Chapter 1, 2: Create a 5/5 Airship Vehicle Token with Haste, Flying and Crew: 3
 - Chapter 3: Sacrifice all Airships you control
    - Journal is a story of expeditioners stealing a bunch of Airships to escape Lumiere.

Expedition 41
 - Color Identity: Rakdos
 - Chapter 1, 2: Destroy target Nevron
 - Chapter 3: Destroy all Nevrons
    - Journal is a story of expeditioners engaged in a competition to see who can kill the most Nevrons.
 
Expedition 69:
 - Color Identity: Green
 - Chapter 1: Search your library for a basic land card and put it into play tapped
 - Chapter 2: Search your library for a non-basic land card and put it into play tapped
 - Chapter 3: Search your library for a basic land card and a non-basic land card and put them into play
    - Journal is a story of exploring everywhere and installing grapple points for those who come after.
 
Expedition 48
 - Color Identity: Red
 - Chapter 1: Target creature an opponent controls deals damage equal to its power to another create target creature that player controls.
 - Chapter 2: Gain control of up to one target creature an opponent controls until end of turn and untap it. That creature gains haste until end of turn.
 - Chapter 3: Gain control of up to two target creatures an opponent controls and untap them. Those creatures gains haste until end of turn. Sacrifice those creatures at end of turn.
    - Journal is basically a story of mutiny, so all chapters are variations on mutiny/disloyalty
    
Expedition 49:
 - Color Identity: White
 - Chapter 1: Gain 2 life for each creature you control
 - Chapter 2: Put a shield counter on each creature you control
 - Chapter 3: Until the end of your opponent's turn, if you control a creature, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.
    - Journal is about expeditioners who carried out their mission through strong defense/healing tactics, which proves to be their downfall as their weak offensive capabilities prove to be ineffective against the Nevrons.

# The Manor

Could be a new "dungeon" that can be ventured into

Or we could re-use the room mechanic introduced in Duskmourn

New dungeon would require enabler/support cards. Room mechanic reuse does not

# Nevrons

Sounding like a sibling race to Eldrazi. ie.

 - No color identity
 - Maybe some Nevrons have elemental affinities so it would have colored mana in its casting cost, but have devoid

Painted Clea can be the "Nevron lord". Some analogue to Sliver Queen since she's the "mother/creator" of all these Nevrons.

All Nevrons have a triggered ability on death to give an opponent a Lumina token

# Chroma

Conceptually ties to mana. Could be something that grants you mana when you a Nevron or Expeditioner dies or a token that can be cashed in for mana at a later point in time (A chroma token, similar to a treasure token?).

# Tokens

Chroma
Token Artifact - Chroma

T, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color, spend this mana only to cast a Nevron, Gestral or Expeditioner spell

Lumina
Token Artifact - Lumina

(Lumina Tokens by themselves do nothing)

# Gestrals

Artifact creatures with some squee-style immortality mechanic
 - Can cast from graveyard/exile
 - If in graveyard at beginning of upkeep, may return to hand
 
Or the immortality mechanic can be an ability of the Sacred River, which should obviously be a legendary land.

# The Fracture

Some saga with a mass-exile effect in one of its chapters.

Or it could just be a nickname reprint of "Urza's Ruinous Blast"

# Gommage

Some mass-exile effect conditonal on number of counters. Possibly tie into the chroma mechanic for exiled creatures.
 - Maybe incorporate clash with an opponent to determine if counters get added or removed. Symbolizing the clash between Renoir and Aline in the canvas.

The monolith is where counters get added or removed.

Or it could be a legendary sorcery with some mass-exile effect

Or it could just be a nickname reprint of "Urza's Ruinous Blast"

Or it could be an ability word for exiling target permanent

Energy Tint - {2}
Artifact

T: Add {C}, If you control at least 3 Lumina tokens, add {C}{C}{C} instead

Equip: {2}

- Need to think more about what MTG mechanic best represents "void damage"

## Pictos/Lumina/Weapons

Easy analogue of Pictos/Weapons is Equpiment. Can map buffs granted by Pictos/Luminas to existing MTG mechanics.
New subtype for interactions with other cards.
All Pictos have a "clone me" ability that can be paid with Lumina tokens (just like one spends Lumina points to get the same pictos ability for other characters)

Some beneficial effect that triggers when you are at 33 life


Name TBD - {1}{W}{U}{B}{R}{G}
Sorcery

You win the game if you control 33 or more of any of the following combined:

 - Expeditioner creatures
 - Chroma Tokens
 - Lumina Tokens

# Modeling shields / break damage

Use Shield Counters. Current rules allow for stacking multiple instances.

For gameplay fairness, should be applied on low/single-toughness creatures.

"Break meter" can be something that charges up with charge counters.

TBD what would model a "Break meter". Some artifact? Some emblem?

Spending the "Break meter" would remove all shield counters from one or more permanents.

Breaker - {1}{W}
Instant

Split Second
Remove all Shield counters from target permanent

Shields up - {X}{W}
Instant

Put X shield counters on target permanent

# NPCs

Lost Gestral
Gestral Merchant
Gestral Villager
Gestral Fighter
Gestral Musician
Gestral Bodyguard
 - Type: Artifact Creature - Gestral
 - Are Gestrals artificial beings in a MTG flavor sense? Alls signs point to this being the case.

Mime
 - Color Identity: TBD
 - Type: Creature - Mime

# Key Characters

Represented as either Legendary Creatures or Planeswalkers. Painters prime candidate to be Planeswalkers

Possibly include the "God" sub-type for painters, painted copies of them

Possibly introduce an "Expeditioner" sub-type just for flavor purposes. To mechanically do something with this type would be parasitic as no Expeditioners exist in any other set.

Sophie:
 - Color Identity: White
 - Type: Legendary Creature - Human Citizen
 - Soulbond or partner with Gustave
Emma:
 - Color Identity: White
 - Type: Legendary Creature - Human Citizen

Gustave - {U}{W}{R}
Legendary Creature - Human Expeditioner Engineer

First strike. Vigilance.
At the beginning of your upkeep and Whenever Gustave attacks or blocks, put a charge counter on him.

Marking Shot - T, Remove a charge counter from Gustave: Put a stun counter on target creature.
Shatter - T, Remove 3 charge counters from Gustave: Gustave deals 5 damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures. Put a stun counter on them.
Overcharge - T, Remove 10 charge counters from Gustave: Gustave deals 10 damage to target creature, if that creature would die, exile it instead.

3/2

Maelle - {1}{U}{R}
Legendary Creature - Human Expeditioner

Offensive Stance - At the beginning of your upkeep, choose one:
 - Put a First strike counter on Maelle
 - Put a Vigilance counter on Maelle
Defensive Stance - At the beginning of your opponent's upkeep, choose one:
 - Put an Indestructible counter on Maelle
 - Put a shield counter on Maelle
At the end of every turn, remove all counters from Maelle.
When Maelle dies, you may exile her instead, if you do and you also control Alicia, exile her and meld them into Maelle (act 3)

3/2

 - some stance-based mechanic that buffs offense when attacking and defense when blocking
 - (Melds with Alicia)

Maelle (act 3)
Color Identity: TBD
Legendary Planeswalker - Maelle
Expeditioner spells you play cost {1} less to cast.
 + ability: TBD
 - ability: Return target Human or Expeditioner in your graveyard or exile and put it into play tapped
 - ability: TBD
 Ultimate: A suitable MTG analogue of Gommage Gradient Attack or Stendahl

Lune - {W}{U}{R}{G}
Legendary Creature - Human Expeditioner Wizard
Flying
Whenever Lune attacks or you cast a white, blue, red or green instant or sorcery spell, put a stain counter on Lune.
Lune cannot have more than 4 stain counters on her.
Immolation - Remove a stain counter from Lune: Lune deals 2 damage to target creature
Crippling Tsunami - Remove 2 stain counters from Lune: Lune deals 3 damage to up to 2 target creatures, put a stun counter on each
Elemental Genesis - Remove 4 stain counters from Lune: Lune deals 4 damage to all creatures your opponents control. If this would deal damage to a Nevron, it deals double that damage instead.

2/4

- Lore accuracy would dicatate that we use colored stain counters, but that is just too many words.
- Damage obviously scaled to MTG levels

Sciel
 - Color Identity: Orzhov
 - Type: Legendary Creature - Human Expeditioner
 - could re-use existing foretell mechanic
 - Some ability that buffs/untaps Expeditioner creatures
Verso
 - Color Identity: Dimir or Esper
 - Type: Legendary Creature - Human Expeditioner
 - Gain rank counters when attacking or using abilities.
    - To tie to his immortality, maybe treat rank counters like shield counters. If it dies or would take damage, remove a rank counter instead.
 - Payoff abilities paid with rank counters or can be activated once a certain number of rank counters is obtained
Monoco
 - Color Identity: Selesnya
 - Type: Legendary Artifact Creature - Gestral
    - Only giving the Artifact supertype because it's a Gestral and our current definition is that Gestrals are artificial beings, despite Monoco having very organic features.
 - Some die roll mechanic that maps to ability wheel
 - Obviously need some MTG mechanic that maps to his feet collection / gain ability mechanic
    - When it kills a nevron, exile it and it gains the abilities of the exiled nevron. Do something akin to Agatha's Soul Cauldron

Noco
 - Color Identity: TBD
 - Type: Legendary Artifact Creature - Gestral
 - Soulbond / Pairs with Monoco

Golgra - {2}{W}{G}{R}
Legendary Artifact Creature - Gestral
Gestral creatures you control get +2/+2
{2}: Put a shield counter on target Gestral you control
Enrage - Whenver Golgra is dealt damage, choose one:

    - - ability: TBD
    - Ultimate: TBD

    - - ability: TBD
    - Ultimate: TBD

Alicia - {2}{W}
Legendary Creature - Human Painter

Activated abilities of Nevrons and Pictos cannot be activated
(Melds with Maelle)

 - Some mechanical allegory to silence or suppressing activated abilities (since she is mute IRL)
 
Simon (possibly double-faced or a Saga creature to represent the various phases)
 - Color Identity: Rakdos
 - Type: Legendary Creature - Human Expeditioner
 
Esquie - {3}{G}{U}
Legendary Artifact Creature - Mount
Saddle 2
As long as you control a card named Soarrie, Esquie has Flying
As long as you control a card named Florrie, Esquie has Islandwalk
As long as you control a card named Urrie, Esquie has "Whenever Esquie attacks, Surveil 2"
When Esquie attacks, if it is saddled choose one:
 - Draw a card
 - Put a land card from your hand into the battlefield
6/6

- Basically, a saddle version of Uro with extra buffs if you control the various rocks that Esquie desires

Painted Alicia
 - Color Identity: TBD
 - Type: Legendary Creature - Painter

Painted Renoir
 - Color Identity: TBD
 - Type: Legendary Creature - Painter

The Paintress
 - Color Identity: TBD
 - Type: Legendary Creature - Painter God

The Curator
 - Color Identity: TBD
 - Type: Legendary Creature - Painter

Perhaps Curator + Paintress can meld into Painted Love
Or Curator is a double-faced card, with (real) Renoir on the other side
Or Paintress is a double-faced card, with Aline on the other side

Noco/Gestrals could have some squee-style immortality mechanic

Maelle/Alicia could be a double-faced card, or melds into "Act 3" Maelle

# Deck Archetypes

Gestral Tribal
Nevron Tribal
Expeditioners
Painter Control

- Having Gestrals, Nevrons and Expeditioners as their own creature types may be too parasitic and prevents synergies with other sets, maybe we just piggy-back off of an existing creature type instead?
- If we were to use existing creature types then probably:
   - Nevrons - Nightmare or Eldrazi
   - Gestrals - Goblin Construct or just Construct
   - Expeditioner - Human

# Adventure Mode Considerations

This set cannot introduce new mechanics (as that would require rule engine updates). That's fine, we have 30+ years of existing MTG mechanics to pool ideas/designs from.

We assume defining new token types is doable in Forge. Otherwise we'll have to reuse existing token types for Chroma/Lumina.

For flavor, we can leverage ability words to group common sets of abilities/functionality (assuming Forge lets us have custom ability words easily)

Can we "localize" some game elements to match the flavor/lore of Expedition 33?

 - Gold -> Chroma
 - Towns -> Gestral Villages/Outposts

Bosses need to map to the 5 color biomes + colorless biome

 - Renoir
 - The Paintress
 - Simon
 - Painted Clea
 - Lampmaster
 - Dualliste
