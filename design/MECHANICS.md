# Mechanics of the Expedition 33 set

## New Mechanics

### Chroma Tokens

Chroma is the life-force of the canvas. The closest MTG analogue is obviously mana, thus Chroma tokens is a variant of a Treasure token

Unlike Treasure tokens, to keep with the theme and flavor of this set, the mana from sacrified Chroma tokens has spending restrictions, only allowing you to spend such mana on Nevrons, Gestrals or Expeditioners

### Expeditoners

All Expeditioners are humans and have an ability that gives you a Chroma Token when they die.

### Nevrons

To signify the reward (loot) for taking down Nevrons in battle, all Nevrons have the triggered ability of giving an opponent a Lumina token when they die.

Giving potential resources to opponents isn't necessarily a bad thing as this set includes various cards that punish opponents or reward you based on how many Lumina tokens they have.

### Lumina Tokens

Lumina Tokens are artifacts that can be sacrified to Scry 1. But that is not just their only purpose, for in this set Lumina tokens may serve as an alternate source of payment for certain spells, abilities and effects. Such as ...

### Pictos

Pictos is a sub-type of Artifact that applies to Equipment. Any Pictos can create a token copy of itself by paying an amount of Lumina tokens (this is our mechanical interpretation of spending lumina points on a levelled up pictos to grant the same passive effects to another character without having to equip it)
