# Mechanics of the Expedition 33 set

## New Mechanics

### Chroma Tokens

Chroma is the life-force of the canvas. The closest MTG analogue is obviously mana, thus Chroma tokens is a variant of a Treasure token

Unlike Treasure tokens, to keep with the theme and flavor of this set, the mana from sacrified Chroma tokens has spending restrictions, only allowing you to spend such mana on Nevrons, Gestrals or Expeditioners, which makes sense as Chroma is the "paint" that Aline and others use to create life in the canvas.

Chroma tokens may be an additional cost on some spells.

Chroma tokens have no relation to the Chroma ability word (aka. proto-devotion) introduced in the Eventide set. No cards in this set use the Chroma ability word.

### Expeditoners

All Expeditioners are humans and have an ability that gives you a Chroma Token when they die. Expeditioner is also a spell sub-type and will generally have Expeditioner-aligned benefits.

### Gradient Spells

Certain instants and sorceries carry the "Gradient" sub-type. These are spells that have painter-aligned benefits.

> DESIGN NOTE: We are somewhat deviating from the video game in that Gradient attacks in the game are always "Epic"-tier attacks in nature. We are re-appropriating the term to be a classifier of instants/sorceries at any rarity. What we lose in lore/thematic correctness, we gain in mechanical flexibility.

### Nevrons

To signify the reward (loot) for taking down Nevrons in battle, all Nevrons have the triggered ability of giving an opponent a Lumina token when they die.

Giving potential resources to opponents isn't necessarily a bad thing as this set includes various cards that punish opponents or reward you based on how many Lumina tokens they have.

### Lumina Tokens

Lumina Tokens are artifacts that can be sacrified to Scry 1. But that is not just their only purpose, for in this set Lumina tokens may serve as an alternate source of payment for certain spells, abilities and effects. Such as ...

### Pictos

A Picto is a sub-type of Artifact that applies to Equipment. Any Picto can create a token copy of itself by paying an amount of Lumina tokens (this is our mechanical interpretation of spending lumina points on a levelled up picto to grant the same passive effects to another character without having to equip it).

An equipment that self-replicates without restrictions would be hideously broken, so the self-replication only happens if you control no existing token copies of any given Picto.

Thus for any given Picto, you can have at most one extra token copy of it.

This restriction is a minor flavor/thematic fail (as the video game has no such restrictions), but game balance trumps flavor/thematic accuracy in this case.
