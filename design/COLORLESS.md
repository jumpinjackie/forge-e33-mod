# Cards

## Chalier

```
1C
Creature - Nevron
When this creature dies, target opponent creates a Lumina token.

2/2
```

### Design Notes

 - Vanilla Nevron. Could not determine approporiate color/elemental affinity so it's colorless.

## Troubador

```
2C
Creature - Nevron
Other nevrons you control get +1/+1.
When this creature dies, target opponent creates a Lumina token.
```

### Design Notes

 - In the game, a Troubador uses its horn to buff the enemy party.
 - Mechanically, I've mapped this to a basic nevron lord buff effect.
