## Esquie, Friend of Verso

Getting the same ordering issue on the Uro modal trigger as Golgra.

## Esquie's Nest

The WUBRG mana ability is not preventatively disabled if you don't meet the activation condition. The ability however will (correctly) not add WUBRG if you don't meet the activation condition.

## Expedition 41

Chapter 3: Not getting lumina tokens for destroyed Nevron tokens

## Expedition Camp

 - The +1/+1 bonus is not being applied.

## Golgra, Gestral Chef

I am being prompted for the mode before the enrage trigger goes on the stack, I kind of expected the prompt to happen on trigger resolution. And the trigger description on the stack is the full modal prompt and not the choice made. Not sure if it ultimately matters because it behaviourally works as expected.

## Manor Door

AI seems to have issues unlocking its own doors. Check if Keys to the House has the same issues.

## Revitalization

 - The graveyard view closes after being prompted to choose a creature card and you are being prompted for a non-creature card. Re-opening the graveyard view lets you pick the non-creature card. Probably a Forge bug.

## The Monolith Interior

 - The copy trigger doubles up if you happen to target itself with the copy ability. I copied this implementation from Vesuvan Doppelganger. Does it have the same problem?
