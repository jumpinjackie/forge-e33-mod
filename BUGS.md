# Golgra, Gestral Chief

I am being prompted for the mode before the enrage trigger goes on the stack, I kind of expected the prompt to happen on trigger resolution. And the trigger description on the stack is the full modal prompt and not the choice made. Not sure if it ultimately matters because it behaviourally works as expected.

# Esquie's Cave

The WUBRG mana ability is not preventatively disabled if you don't meet the activation condition. The ability however will (correctly) not add WUBRG if you don't meet the activation condition.

# Esquie, Friend of Verso

Getting the same ordering issue on the Uro modal trigger as Golgra.

# Lost Gestral

Chroma gift trigger not triggering

# Expedition 41

Chapter 3: Not getting lumina tokens for destroyed Nevron tokens

# Revitalization

Can target any two cards in graveyard (the creature and non-creature restrictions are being ignored)

# Petank

Reward is not triggering
